/*  2016-07-07 List updated to display items in the order the party finds them,
 *  instead of the original haphazard list. Order is Avatar, Shamino, Dupre, Iolo.
 *  Also fixes the spacing so adding companion-authors does not push text down.
 *
 *  2016-07-15 Added Quality 122 section to allow accusing Marsten of betraying
 *  his city, and if Pomdirgun is dead, sets the flag Monitor NPCs check.

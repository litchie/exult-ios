2008-06-03	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	BIG Commit (TM). Quite likely, there are a lot of bugs.
	* Version bump to 1.04.05cvs due to massive internal changes and also due to
	  the fact that pre-1.04.05cvs animation data is INCOMPATIBLE with CVS head
	  and WILL NOT WORK. Also, pre-1.04.05cvs versions of Exult WILL CHOKE and
	  most likely die with this new data.
	* Warning: previous versions of Exult Studio lost information when it saved
	  weapons.dat, monsters.dat and ammo.dat data files. There is a command to
	  fix this by reloading the static data; this will only affect shapes that
	  had this data in the original: the Death Scythe would be reset, but if you
	  gave weapon data to a door, it would not be reset.
	* msvcstuff/*: Added new files to projects.
	* Makefile.mingw: 'turbo', configurable makefile. Command-line parameters
	  or environment variables can now be used to specify the workings of a
	  MinGW compilation.
	* De-hard-coded data:
	  - What items are lightweight (i.e., weight 1/10 normal) such as coins;
	  - What items have quantity-dependent frames (e.g., arrows);
	  - What items constitute 'locked' containers (such as locked chests);
	  - What items are volatile explosives (such as the powder keg);
	  - The frame of food items (shape 377) dropped by monsters;
	  - Creatures which don't eat;
	  - Creatures immune to freezing;
	  - Content rules for containers (such as the Jawbone, which accepts only
	    teeth, and urns, which reject everything);
	  - Frame- and quality-dependent hit points for otherwise indestructible
	    objects (such as powder keg being destroyed if quality == 0, but not
	    otherwise, or wooden doors being destructible but metal doors not);
	  - Frame- and quality-dependent names (for example, SI urns and bodies
	    showing the NPC name, reagents, several SI quest items, etc);
	  - How much warmth is given by worn items. Such data is also included for
	    BG items by default, and is based on SI data.
	* Changed formats:
	  - Creatures that can teleport, summon or turn invisible no longer have
	    their data saved to monsters.dat; this is because non-monsters can also
	    have these capabilities. Instead, it is saved to shape_info.txt. For
	    backward compatibility, the monster.dat data is still read.
	  - As mentioned above, animation data has changed dramaticaly and is not
	    backwards-compatible. Exult will ignore old data, and previous versions
	    of Exult will most likely crash if given the new data.
	  - Due to a New Thing (tm) being tried for dead bodies, the first frame of
	    any body shape should be empty (as it is for all bodies in the original
		games).
	* Changed/modified intrinsics:
	  - get_npc_prop/set_npc_prop: You can now get/set an object's health. This
	    is done, for example, by the serpent statue at the end of SI, but it can
	    be done in BG or SI for any objects that have hit points.
	    Additionally, experience changes are divided by 2 -- this happens in the
	    original games, and reduces overall XP inflation.
	  - set_to_attack: Can be used to attack tiles, not just objects. The originals
	    can do this, but never did so.
	  - attack_object: Finally fully implemented, it now just forwards the call
	    to Combat_schedule::attack_target.
	  - apply_damage: Forwards to Actor::apply_damage or Game_object::apply_damage.
	  - fire_projectile: Last unknown parameter is attack value to use when the
	    missile reaches its target.
	  - get_item_flag: Flags 13 (power safe) and 14 (immune to death magic) have
	    been implemented. no_spell_casting is actually flag 31 in SI.
	  - play_sound_effect2: Sound volume is now adjusted for distance, even if
	    relative changes.
	  - remove_item: Will no longer delete NPCs, just remove them from map.
	* New things allowed in BG:
	  - You can now get/set temperature. If the gump shape has enough frames,
	    it will also change like in SI. The following intrinsics can be called
	    from BG now: get_temperature, set_temperature, get_temperature_zone,
		get_npc_warmth.
	* General changes: Most shape data previously available in shapes/miscinf.cc
	  has been moved out. Likewise, the shape information classes from the file
	  shapes/shapeinf.* have been moved out, so that this file contains only the
	  Shape_info class. The shapes/*inf.* files (except for miscinf.*) have
	  single classes that each handle a set of correlated data (basically,
	  sections in text data files or U7/SI dat files). These classes were
	  structured for editing and allowing the use of differential patches.
	  The ready.dat data has been conceptually split into a spot and flag.
	* The attack/damage system has been overhauled based on statistical data
	  gathered from the originals, as well as a series of carefully crafted
	  tests to determine sequencing as much as possible. There is also a lot of
	  new data implemented. This affects combat as well as several intrinsics.
	  NPCs with tournament flag will be extremely tough now.
	* Dead NPCs will kneel and die, while NPCs put to sleep will kneel and lie
	  down. NPCs can also become unconscious from damage. Also, flying NPCs will
	  fall to the ground and take damage in these cases.
	* Dead bodies have been extended to store 16-bit NPC numbers.
	* Non-actors are no longer able to use set_to_attack/attack usecode.
	* The experience formula is now a near-exact match to the original games'.
	* Improved readying new weapons. Works very close to the original games,
	  including the fact that readying a 1-handed weapon also readies a shield
	  if the off-hand is free.
	* Monster stats are randomized; the randomization is based on statistical
	  tests in the original games. The same applies to initial monster attack
	  modes.
	* Prevented the use of objects (including keys) is they are contained in a
	  locked container. You also can't put objects inside locked containers
	  anymore, nor can you take them out, nor can they be found by most usecode
	  intrinsics. This is likely to cause problems...
	* Item names in SI and SS are remapped the other way around now: SI messages
	  are remapped to SS message IDs instead of having some message IDs in SS be
	  remapped from SI values. This is done when the messages are read.
	* Changed SFX distance formula to give a more realistic fall-off.
	* Exult Studio can now recognize and edit all of the data from the original
	  *.dat files as well as all de-hard-coded data present in the following
	  files: bodies.txt, paperdol_info.txt, shape_info.txt; this includes the
	  data de-hard-coded mentioned above.
	* First steps towards the ability to browse for games: consolidated the way
	  games are handled, by using the identity of a game to detect the flexes it
	  uses. Also allowed concurrent use of BG and FoV, Si and SS; Exult will now
	  recognize "forgeofvirtue" and "silverseed" as well as "blackgate" and
	  "serpentisle", and the parameters "--fov" and "--ss" in addition to "--bg"
	  and "--si". The older parameters will still load FoV and SS if the unmodded
	  games are not installed.

2008-06-01	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* conf/Configuration.cc: Recognize paths starting with "../" as relative
	  paths. This should fix bug #1738138.
	* mapedit/shapedraw.cc: Extra safety when drawing centered shapes.
	* gameclk.h, shapes/vgafile.cc: Change initialization order in constructors
	  to reduce number of GCC 4.x warnings. Also, added code to recover memory
	  used by shape_sources when reseting Vga_file.
	* cheat.cc, shapeid.h, usecode/ucdebugging.h, usecode/conversation.h,
	  pathfinder/PathFinder.h, gumps/*.h: Added virtual destructors to virtual
	  base classes and their derived classes.
	* objs/mappatch.cc: Replacing iterator++ with faster ++iterator.
	* cheat_screen.cc, objs/flags.h: Correcting flags based on original games.
	* actorio.cc: Removed double-check on monster death before write.
	* usecode/ucdisasm.cc: Added some more special cases.
	* files/databuf.h: Added clear_error virtual method to DataBuffer classes.
	* docs/u7tech.txt: Full documentation of upcoming changes to *.dat files,
	  based on the original games. Some changes for u7iregXX documentation.
	* tools/ucdump.c, tools/mklink.c: Eliminating a few warnings.

2008-05-31  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* various: initialize variables, minor clean-up 

2008-05-30  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* various: initialize variables
	* schedule.cc: don't access member variable after being deleted

2008-05-28	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* objs/objs.cc: Removed fire-vs-ice effect previously introduced.
	* usecode/intrinsics.cc: Fixed powder-keg-as-weapon case of attack_object
	  intrinsic to behave as the original does; incidentaly, this fixes the
	  gwani horn. This is a temporary workaround, until attacks and intrinsics
	  are "properly" fixed to behave like the originals.

2008-05-27  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* various: some 64-bit and/or gcc 4.1 compilation fixes
	* objs/chunks.cc: delete[] vs delete
	* various: initialize some variables

2008-05-26    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* objs/objs.cc: In SI, fire-damage destroys ice wall and blocks,
	so you can free Gwenno.

2008-05-23    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* shapes/miscinf.cc: Don't infinite loop if animated object has
	been rotated.

	* objs/barge.cc (Barge_object): Changed criteria for gathering
	'barge' objects so flags aren't caught (but the ice-raft still works).

2008-05-03    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* effects.cc (Projectile_effect): Fixed crash involving trap.

2008-04-14    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* objs/chunks.cc (Chunk_cache): The 'blocking' detection now
	handles lifts >= 15, and should save a bit of memory for chunks
	with lifts < 8.

	* objs/citerate.h (public): Fixed bug when size is 1x1.

2008-03-30    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* cheat.cc, etc: Support higher lifts, up to 255.  Note that the
	file formats still need to change for this to fully work.

2008-03-21	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* exultmenu.cc: Was missing in previous commit; updated mod manager to use
	  vectors and classes instead of pointer to vectors and classes.
	* All: Fixed default game directory to be the Exult.cfg-defined game name.

2008-03-20	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* studio.cc: Fixed long-standing mod-manager crash.
	* all: Updated/reformatted mod manager files to use vectors and classes
	  instead of pointer to vectors and classes. Improved default game directory
	  to be the Exult.cfg-defined game name (e.g., BG and SI have default dirs
	  './blackgate' and './serpentisle'). Some readmes were updated accordingly.

2008-03-15	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Fixing bug that caused reserved NPC #356 to be available when creating
	a new NPC.

2008-02-26	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* UCC: Added integer casting: '(byte)', '(char)', '(int)' and '(long)' will
	  force, respectfully, 8-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit integers. Default is
	  16-bit integer, and warnings will be issued in some cases. UCC does *not*
	  try to guess integer sizes anymore, except for function IDs and jump
	  offsets, to prevent past problems.
	* Keyring/SI Fixes: Eliminated compilation warnings due to the UCC changes.
	  Fixed 10-fold error in (unused) DAY constant. Added new diagonal moongates
	  to keyring.

2008-02-25	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	UCC: Fixed actor frame keyword bug.

2008-02-23	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed palette rotation bug on portraits by making them all translucent.
	* Fixed crash on SI when BG Paperdolls are turned off and a character's gump
	  is opened. Switched shape data to load after game flx is laded.

2008-02-18	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	UCC: Improved handling of structs. Added a manner of specifying the integer
	size of enums with the (optional) constructs
		enum IDENTIFIER : int { const list };
		enum IDENTIFIER : byte { const list };
		enum IDENTIFIER : char { const list };

2008-02-18	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* audio/Audio.cc: Fixed occasional segfault when doing garbage collection
	  on SFX cache.
	* pathfinder/Zombie.cc: End path if new z coordinate is less than zero.
	* Others: Switched iterator postfix increment to faster prefix increment.

2008-02-17	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	UCC: Fixed usecode structs generating wrong indices into array. Fixed aliases
	to structs and classes so they can be of differing base types. Static structs
	can now be dlaclared.

2008-02-16	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* usecode/ucsched.*, usecode/ucscriptop.h: Implemented two new opcodes from
	  the originals: wait_while_near and wait_while_far, which cause the script
	  to halt depending on the avatar's distance from the script object. Step
	  opcode 0x53 has been revised with a (verified) delta-z parameter. Due to
	  SI's buggy usecode, which neglects to add this extra parameter on any of
	  the uses of this opcode, most of the steps taken with this opcode will
	  fail to happen -- which incidentally also happens in the original games.
	* usecode/ucinternal.cc: Added opcodes to perform the following operations
	  with usecode class member variables: array loop, aidx, set array elem.
	  Also slightly modified aidx so that it exactly matches the originals.
	  Allowing array size changes in BG too, as it is possible, even if it is
	  not used, in the original.
	* usecode/compiler/*: Added usecode structs; they are defined like classes,
	  except that they cannot have member functions and do not have inheritance.
	  They also have minimal type-checking, unlike classes, being thin wrappers
	  around normal usecode arrays. Example definition and use:
		struct Tile { var x; var y; var z; }	// Definition
		struct<Tile> pos = get_object_position();
		pos.x += 1;
	  Structs with struct members simply merge the variables of the inner struct.
	  For example, using the Tile struct above,
		struct Obj { var object; struct<Tile> pos; }
	  is completely equivalent to
		struct Obj { var object; var x; var y; var z; }
	  In fact, the 'pos' member struct can be defined without a name:
		struct Obj { var object; struct<Tile>; }
	  Also added reference or alias variables, which are a relabelling of the
	  variable. This can be used to 'cast' a var to a struct or from a struct
	  to another. Syntax:
	    var alias varname = declared_var;
	    struct<defined_struct> alias varname = declared_var;
	    class<defined_class> alias varname = declared_class;
	  In all cases, an ampersand ('&') can replace the word 'alias'. These are
	  compile-time references only, not dynamical ones.
	  Improved localization of errors/warnings for a few statements.
	  Added ability to specify initial counter for inner repeat script command.
	  Also added 'wait while near' and 'wait while far' script commands which
	  take a parameter (distance); they are the UCC version of the new script
	  opcodes wait_while_near and wait_while_far, mentioned above.
	  Defined built-in constants for 'actor frame' script command.
	  Added ability to specify delta-z for 'step' script command.
	  'music' script command now allows the use of a 'repeat' flag, based on
	  previously implemented behavior.
	  Script command 'face' can now use the same built-in constants as 'step'.
	  Usecode 'true' and 'false' can be used as (very limited) int literals.
	  Made a general replacement of postfix increments of STL iterators in favor
	  of the faster prefix increment.
	  Fixed recently-introduced bug in handling of array loops which would end
	  without any of their operators.
	* content/*/src/*: General switch to 'step', 'face' and 'actor frame'
	  built-in constants, which in some cases mean using a different flavor of
	  'step' than was being used. General reformat of dialogs for readability.
	  In SI Fixes, you can now ask Shamino to set your watch to 24-hour format
	  if you prefer. In Keyring, Laurianna now uses UI_change_npc_faceX instead
	  of the old method.

2008-02-14	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	UCC: Labels now start their own single-statement block. This allows code
	like 'if (expression) label: statement' to work as in C/C++. Fixed bug in
	swith statements where last case was not correctly linked to the switch end
	block. Added a few more block optimizations (double jumps, double rets of
	the same type, double aborts). Fixed crash on empty functions. End-function
	return is only added if there isn't one already.
	*** UCC: Fixed bug when a block is empty but is target of conditional jumps.
	*** UCC: Fixed bug that caused removal of last block. Uc_fun_name_expression
	and Uc_bool_expression are constants, so they should evaluate to true.
	Uc_binary_expression and Uc_unary_expression failed to set return if their
	inner expressions were not constants.

2008-02-12	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	UCC: Removing old way of handling labels. Improved dead-block detection.
	Fixed bug in IF statements without a corresponding ELSE statement. Fixed
	a few leaks. Eliminated premature while(0) and if (0) optimizations since
	a GOTO statement may point to somewhere inside these otherwise unreachable
	blocks.

2008-02-08	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Exult: Removing 32-bit match check for init_loop opcode.
	* UCC: Fixed the use of declared constants for function IDs/shapes.
	  Added several contant-expression optimizations, particularly for while
	  and do...while loops. Added 32-bit-detectino routine which works correctly
	  considering signed 16-bit bounds. Also, allowing 'continue' statements on
	  'for' and 'converse' loops as well as disallowing 'break' statements
	  except for loops and switches. Finally, modified code generation to use
	  basic blocks instead; this allows for some small code optimizations to be
	  performed (e.g., 'if (cond) break; else statements' having only one jump
	  instead of 3) as well as finally being able to use 32-bit jumps with UCC.

2008-02-03    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* actors.cc: Fixed bug where companions would walk on water.

2008-01-27    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* schedule.cc, actions.cc, actions.h: Made the 'talk' schedule
	more aggressive, so it's harder for the Avatar to get away.

2008-01-27	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	"Fixed" operator precedence rules for UCC to be more like those of C/C++.
	Making UCC emit bytes for script opcodes as the originals do; UCC is
	now able to declare byte constants with 'const char' and 'const byte'.
	For the same reasons, functions called with CALLE are also linked in the
	same way as functions called with CALL; functions with 32-bit function ids,
	as well as class methods, are not linked. Finally, function IDs/shapes can
	now be specified through defined constants.

2008-01-25	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	MinGW specific: Removed Makefile.studio.mingw file; compilation in MinGW now
	uses only Makefile.mingw. Compilation/distribution os ES and the GIMP plug-in
	is done with the (self-explanatory) commands 'studioinstall', 'studiodist',
	'maptools', 'maptoolsinstall', 'maptoolsdist' and 'studioclean'.
	Makefile.mingw commands 'allclean' and 'allinstall' also clean and install
	(respectivelly) Exult Studio (but not the GIMP plug-in).
	Also updated Readme.win32 accordingly.

2008-01-19	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Added overloaded methods for Fast_pathfinder_client::is_grabable to make
	  use of the new distance function.
	* Exult Studio/Exult can now search for a shape of a given frame as well.
	* Fixed can_avatar_reach_pos intrinsic.
	* Switched from DELTA_WRAP_CHECK and DELTA_CHECK macros to static inline
	  functions to prevent possible undetected problems.
	* Update of MSVC projects, including a new project for ES (though I doubt
	  it compiles).

2008-01-11    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* actions.cc (Path_walking_actor_action): 'speed' wasn't being
	initialized, sometimes causing SI to hang at start.

2008-01-09    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* objs/objs.cc: Fixed macro bug in DELTA_WRAP_CHECK that affected
	the 'distance' computation.

2008-01-08  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* exult.cc: fix --buildmap

2007-12-11	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* actors.cc, actions.h: Fixed crash when avatar finishes a usecode path.
	  Double-stepping problem is completelly fixed, resulting in perfectly
	  smooth scrolling if it is enabled. Also, added slight delay at the end
	  of all acions, whether they are done by the avatar or by other NPCs.
	* paths.cc, tiles.h, objs/objs.cc: Fixed distance function so it actualy
	  does what it should. Added back a 2d distance function for pathfinders.

2007-12-05    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* mapedit/eggedit.cc, mapedit/exult_studio.glade: Support z-coord
	in intermap teleport eggs.

2007-11-07  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* exult.cc, gamewin.*, gumps/GameplayOptions_gump.cc : Made lerping a 
	  percentage value. Default now to 75% that makes things not quite as 
	  smooth as they were before and seems to be a reasonable tradeoff. 
	  GameplayObjects now has options for disabled, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%
    * actors.cc : Fixing avatar combat problems, but this really needs a 
      proper solution to my double step problem. The code i've written seems to
      have a few unintended consequences causing extra long pauses when moving
	
2007-11-06  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* effects.cc, exult.cc, gamerend.cc, gamewin.cc, gamewin.h : Two words:
	  "Smooth Scrolling". Some more words: It's a bit of a hack but it works
	  really well. The screen position is interpolated based on the camera 
	  actor's animation rate or get_std_delay() if it's not set. The camera 
	  actor's position is also interpolated (though in a really hacky manner)
	  so the avatar's movement isn't jerky. All other objects do NOT have their
	  movement interpolated, but just smooth avatar movement is a HUGE 
	  improvement. Added config key "config/gameplay/smooth_scrolling"
	  to control this. This is enabled by default for now. Code diffs should 
	  highlight how things have changed.
	* actors.cc : Added a slight hack to Main_actor::handle_event to stop
	  some 'double stepping' that was looking really bad with smooth 
	  scrolling. See the comment in the code for details
	* gumps/GameplayOptions_gump.* : Added toggle for smooth scrolling.

2007-11-04    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* server/server.cc: Support 'locate' with 'quality' in ES.

	* exult.cc: Show FPS.  Also, made an experimental change to the
	event'loop's rendering condition.

2007-10-31	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Fixed a few opcode bugs. Also, swapped the purpose of cnt1 and cnt2 in the
	repeat2 script opcode and removed the initial "reset" of the counter. Both
	changes are verified in the originals.

2007-10-30	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Fixed crash whan attacking objects bare-handed.

2007-10-29	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* monsters.cc: Setting quality for monster equipment only if it is a weapon
	  that uses charges.
	* actors.cc: Preventing actors from taking a step if it would change their
	  z coordinate by more than 1. NPCs now look for combat more often. Lastly,
	  paralyze flag completely prevents movement.
	* gamewin.cc: Paralyze flag completely prevents avatar from moving.
	* combat.cc: Entering combat mode with a readied spellbook no longer makes
	  it disappear with SI paperdolls.
	* schedule.cc: Scripts in patrol schedule are no longer dont_halt.
	* egg.cc: Increased duration of continuous weather eggs to 100 hours.
	  This has been confirmed in the originals.

2007-10-26	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Fixing recently introduced distance calculation bug.

2007-10-23	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* effects.*, shapes/miscinf.*, data/*: Added ability to specify explosion
	  SFX based on shape. This seems to better match the originals' behavior.
	* usecode/*: Added a few usecode script opcodes and modified the behavior
	  of another, all based on the originals:
	  - music opcode causes it to loop indefinitely if the high-byte is nonzero.
	  - reset opcode (0xa) which causes a script to go back to the start.
	  - delay_minutes (0x28) which works like its name suggests.
	  - weather opcode (0x5A) which allows scripts to change weather.
	  delay_hours has also been fixed so now it works.
	* actors.*: Removed a few redundant cases from Actor::figure_weapon_pos.
	  Changed maximum value of food stat and added new behavior for set/get_prop
	  based on original games: prop 10 gets/sets sex flag, prop 11 gets if the
	  NPC is using a weapon with uses >= 2.
	* actorio.cc: Sex type flag seems to be reversed in initial SI savegame,
	  absent for BG; this has been verified with get_prop intrinsic, as above.
	* mapedit/*: Added hex display of shapes and shape ranges in shape browser.
	* content/sifixes/*: General reformatting (particularly the comments were
	  word-wrapped at about 80 chars width) and code update. Also, added tons of
	  global flags compiled by Malignant Manor; dozens more still to come.

2007-10-21 Dominik Reichardt <dominus@users.sourceforge.net>
	* docs/xml/docs.xml,faq.xml: updated documentation and FAQ
	* docs/ReadMe.html,FAQ.html: updated documentation and FAQ
	* Readme, FAQ: updated
	
2007-10-14	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Changed the way that distance is calculated. It now includes object size
	  and z-coordinate into consideration, and results are U7 & SI verified.
	* Implemented intelligence/shape type check to prevent animals from opening
	  doors when pathfinding.

2007-10-13	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* effects.*: Projectiles and explosions now require a Game_object attacker
	  instead of an actor. Also, a projectile sprite can now be different from
	  the ammo info to be used when it hits, and the speed of the projectile can
	  be adjusted separately. Renamed 'Special_projectile' to be the (better,
	  but still not ideal) 'Homing_projectile'.
	* actor.cc, objs/*: Allow use of hand weapons in usecode_attack. Allowing
	  all ireg objects to make usecode attacks. Added reduce_health virtual
	  method to Game_objects.
	* All others: more intrinsics uncovered/improved with rip/wud/wuc combo:
	  - Intrinsics 'apply_damage' and 'reduce_health', as well as UCC script 'hit'
	    opcode now cause damage to objects too.
	  - 'fire_cannon' intrinsic renamed to 'fire_projectile'; unknown parameters
	    have been decoded and implemented. Also, this intrinsic is confirmed to
		be present in SI as intrinsic 0x8C.
	  - 'explode' intrinsic renamed to 'attack_object'; unknown parameters have
	    been decoded and implemented.
	  - SI Intrinsics 0xA and 0xB are, respectively, 'change_npc_face0' and
	    'change_npc_face1'. They take a frame as a parameter and change the face
	    in the corresponding slot to this frame. Exult also makes them available
	    for BG.
	  - 'set_to_attack' intrinsic and script 'attack' opcode can also be used
	    with non-actor objects.
	  The intrinsic documentation has been updated accordingly. These changes
	  also affect UCC.
	  Finally, changed translucency in faces to affect only large faces.

2007-10-11	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed bug in UCC do-while loops.
	* Modified the way apply_damage intrinsic works. This seems to better match
	  the way it worked in the original games. Docs changed accordingly.
	* Fixed avatar skins on new games with new maps.

2007-10-08	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fast_pathfinder_client::is_grabable now allows you to pick up objects if
	  you can path-find to up to 3 tiles away from the object; this seem to be a
	  better match to the original games.

2007-10-06	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed a couple bugs in the Keyring mod.
	* Eliminated the (virtually unused) SIFlags variable, enum and associated
	  functions from Exult. Its sole use (the naked flag from the cheat screen)
	  has been moved to flag 38 (which was unused in the originals) so that it
	  can be used from usecode also (to make things easier for skin packs).
	* Exult Studio now edits more NPC flags, including the SI flags.
	* Added an SI version of the BG's 'dont_move' flag. Now, flag 16 is named as
	  'bg_dont_render' (BG) or 'dont_move' (otherwise), while flag 22 is called
	  'bg_dont_move' (BG) or 'dont_render' (otherwise). Renamed 'si_tournament'
	  flag to simply 'tournament'.
	* Ignore "don't move mode" and "don't render" when map-editing.
	* Corrected and updated intrinsic documentation.
	* Making the new naked flag works more like nakedness did in SI.

2007-10-04	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed a few bugs in the Keyring mod.
	* Fixed bugs #1727116 and #1770090

2007-10-02    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* npctime.cc (Npc_hunger_timer): Fixed hunger.

2007-09-21	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* audio/Midi.cc: Fixed crash when playing midi music on title screen of mods
	  with a custom mainshp.flx.

2007-09-02	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* audio/Audio.*, objs/animate.*: Fixed memory leak. Improved sfx cache.
	  Removed 'repeat' variable from Object_sfx as it was redundant.
	* usecode/ucxt/data/u7opcodes.data: A few output fixes.
	* usecode/compiler/uclex.ll: Fixed bug in line numeration of commented lines.
	* content/*: Compatibiility update for changes in UCC.
	* usecode/*, usecode/compiler/*, mapedit/*: The original games seem to make
	  a distinction between 'object' functions (fun id < 0x800) and 'utility'
	  functions (fun id > 0x800); the former are called in usecode with CALLE
	  opcode exclusivelly, while the latter use only CALL opcode and inherit the
	  itemref from the caller function. All 'object' functions have a 'phantom'
	  parameter in their function headers which is never used and always zero in
	  the originals. This behavior has been implemented in Exult now.
	  UCC has been updated to take this behavior in consideration, and you can
	  now declare object functions by using 'object#' or 'shape#'; the difference
	  being that the latter is bound to a given shape, whereas the former is not.
	  'object#' is used like 'shape#', but can have nothing in the parenthesis;
	  additionally, functions with ids < 0x400 are considered to be 'shape#' and
	  functions with ids < 0x800 are considered to be 'object#'. UCC will display
	  tons of warnings and errors related to this to ensure 'proper' coding.
	  Also, Exult Studio has been updated to accept only 'object#' or 'shape#'
	  functions for eggs, NPCs, etc.
	* cheat_screen.cc: Making setting/clearing in_party flag work correctly in
	  both, the normal and advanced NPC flag editors.

2007-08-14    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* objs/animate.cc (Frame_animator): Re-initialize animator if
	frame got set outside valid range.  Fixed problem with water of
	ethicality in SI.  (Not sure if this is the best fix...)

2007-07-12	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* audio/Midi.cc: Don't use exceptions for patch music flexes.
	* audio/midi_drivers/LowLevelMidiDriver.cpp: Destroy cond also when the
	  driver is destroyed.
	* usecode/compiler/ucfun.cc: Only add terminating return opcode to functions
	  that don't already have one.

2007-07-12  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* audio/midi_drivers/* : Changes to the MidiDriver code as per Exult 
	  bug report 1750743, with additional changes to ensure that it actually
	  works properly in all cases. Also fixed possible problems with sequence
	  speed being set to 0, notes being cut off early at the end of a song and 
	  renamed some variables so they properly relfect what they actually are.
	* msvcstuff/wud.vcproj : Changes so this project compiles

2007-07-11	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* gamemap.cc, files/databuf.h: Removed OVectorDataSource in favor of
	  StreamDataSource + stringstream. Added 'write' virtual method to
	  DataSource which writes a string to the source.
	* mapedit/*: Removed unused definitions.
	* gamedat.cc, gamewin.h: Fixed flex multimap savegames to save an inner
	  flex (containing the IREG files) for each map after the first.

2007-07-08	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed bug which would cause a purple outline to be displayed around NPCs
	  during some animations in recent snapshots of Exult.

2007-07-07	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
	* PocketPC: Set audio system to just USE_FMOPL_MIDI
			The theory is, this may reduce crashes, as Timidity doesn't
				appear to work, and MT32 could be having problems.

2007-07-02	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
	* PocketPC: Fixed bug with "Normal" option w/ D-PAD
			Normal option couldn't be selected
			
2007-07-01	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* content/*: Making usecode of the SI Fixes and LB joining mods compile.
	* usecode/compiler/ucsym.cc: UCC now issues a warning for every function
	  that gets autonumbered unless '#autonumber' directive is used.
	* usecode/compiler/uclex.yy: Optimizing lexical scanner a bit.
	* palette.cc, gameclk.cc: Fixing problems with infravision and (possibly)
	  invisibility palettes.
	* effects.cc: Tweaking duration of rain and snow a bit.
	* gamewin.cc, cheat_screen.cc, mapedit/npclst.cc, usecode/ucinternal.cc,
	  content/islefaq/initgame.dat: NPCs with numbers in the [356, 359] range
	  are hidden by Exult and ES, not being available for new NPCs. Also, these
	  'reserved' NPC numbers will not be converted to NPCs by intrinsics.
	  Other than that, negative usecode numbers will be converted to NPCs
	  whenever possible, like positive numbers; this effectivelly removes the
	  NPC # limit from Exult.
	  Finally, the SF Island patch has been remade to avoid using NPCs in the
	  range mentioned above.
	* usecode/compiler/ucsym.cc: Fixed Uc_function_symbol constructor not
	  initializing all class variables.

2007-06-30	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* (general): Adding missing newlines to end of files. Making numeric keypad
	  work for number input and return in gumps/menus.
	* usecode/ucsym.cc: Making shape# work again if using old auto-numbering.
	* mapedit/*: Allow separate viewing of shape functions in usecode browser.
	* content/bgkeyring/src/spells/npc_spells.uc: Reagents were being incorrectly
	  counted and used.
	* content/*: Updated old usecode to a more modern form. Fixed dialog bugs in
	  SF island and fixed initial scene.

2007-06-29	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
	* ChangeLog: Corrected date for yesterday's entry
	* PocketPC;touchscreen: Added toggleRight and toggleDouble functions to
			touchscreen class
	* PocketPC;Keyboard_gump: Cleaned up ActivateOtherButton function
				Added per-state ActivateOtherButton functions
	* PocketPC;Keyboard_gump: Enabled saving & loading of on-screen keyboard
			position and state
	* PocketPC;Keyboard_gump: Added getState and getCorner accessor functions
	* PocketPC: Added "KEYBOARD_POSITION" action	
	* PocketPC: Added "KEYBOARD_MODE" action
	* Added README.PocketPC
	* PocketPC: Added "Normal" option to d-pad options (in case someone has
			custom keybindings)

2007-06-28	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
	* PocketPC: Added touchscreen class
			Allows users to set mouse to double click mode
			Allows users to set mouse to right click mode
			Users can do both double click and right click modes
			Added TOUCHSCREEN_MODE action, so it can be mapped to a key
	* PocketPC: Added double click and right click functions (as noted above)
		to the keypad and hotpad keyboards
			
2007-06-27	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
	* PocketPC: Fixed scaling problem
	* PocketPC;Keyboard_gump: Cleaned up Keyboard_gump.h a bit
			Set private & public appropriately

2007-06-26	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
	* PocketPC: Added keypad and hotpad keyboards
		Keypad is basically the numpad on a normal keypad
		Hotpad enables running and a few other nifty functions

2007-06-24	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* gamewin.cc, gameclk.*: Fixed a few bugs in palette problems, particularly
	  when teleporting around.
	* content/bgkeyring/*/*: Fixed a few bugs in Zauriel's functions, improved
	  one of the cutscenes.
	* A few aligning spaces were converted to tabs.

2007-06-24	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
	* PocketPC: Updated on-screen keyboard colors
	* PocketPC: Fixed alt & ctrl on-screen keyboard malfunction
	* PocketPC: Fixed minimize bug (had to tell SDL to minimize twice to be sure
				would erase the whole window, in certain PocketPC setups).
	* MSVC9: Updated Makefile.data so it wouldn't rebuild the flx files every time
				
2007-06-24	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
	* PocketPC: Added on-screen keyboard feature

2007-06-24	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* palette.cc, gameclk.cc: Fixed a few problems with palette transitions and
	  faded-out palettes.
	* gumps/Paperdoll_gump.cc: Also allow showing of usecode container in BG
	  if Exult is compiled with -DSHOW_USECODE_CONTAINER

2007-06-23	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed bugs where avatar faces would not be removed from the screen by
	  calls to remove_npc_face intrinsic.

2007-06-21	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
    * PocketPC: Added "exult.cfg.txt" as a config file option
		Exult will look for exult.cfg.txt first (using U7exists)
		If it is not found, then Exult will use exult.cfg
		This is so PocketPC users can easily edit the config file by default
		Most PocketPC devices natively do NOT have the ability to rename extensions
			or to easily edit anything that is not already a registered type
		This feature can be made easily available to other OSes by defining
			EASY_USER_CONFIGURATION_FILE (with the value of 'exult.cfg.txt')
	* PocketPC: Possibly fixed semi-random 'minimize' bug (when minimizing, some
			of the main PocketPC GUI would be covered by graphics from Exult).
			Needs more testing.
						
2007-06-20	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
    * Fixed PocketPC 'minimize' function querks
    * Fixed PocketPC dpad keymap loading bug

2007-06-17	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* New intrinsic from SI discovered with rip/wud/wuc: intrinsic 0x96 is
	  'can_avatar_reach_pos'. Since Exult already offers a more powerful variant
	  ('is_dest_reachable', which works for any NPC not just the avatar), this
	  intrinsic has *not* been made available to BG.

2007-06-19	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
	* Started PocketPC 'minimize' function
		Needs good placement
		Minimize feature can be ran by attempting to quit the game, choosing no, then choosing yes to minimize
		There are a few querks when reactivating Exult that need to be fixed
	* Fixed type-o in ChangeLog (from Lanaca to Lanica on 2007-06-16)
	* Removed PocketPC hardcoded configuration file location (was set to load from "\Exult\exult.cfg")
	* Fixed PocketPC relative pathing error (PocketPC does not have a "current directory")
	* Created easy way for dpad keymaps to be changed (Gameplay options, "D-PAD") for PocketPC users

2007-06-18	Lanica Dragon (Phillip T. George <me@PhillipGeorge.com>)
	(Checked into CVS on 2007-06-19)
	* Fixed Makefile.common bug where EXPACK_CHECK would not get properly updated with Windows platforms
	* Updated MSVC9 project files to include "release" mode and also the PocketPC 2003 target

2007-06-17	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed special lights to work again.
	* Fixed UCC bug where a function's symbol type in the symbol table be
	  "extern" if the function was externed before being defined.
	* Added three new intrinsics from SI discovered with rip/wud/wuc:
		intrinsic 0x64 is resurrect_npc
		intrinsic 0xB9 is get_temperature_zone
		intrinsic 0xBB is get_npc_warmth
	  This affects UCC, WUD and WUC as well.
	* actors.cc: Fixed warmth given by several items.
	* gumps/Stats_gump.cc: Fixed slightly innacurate frame <> temperature map.


2007-06-16    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* exult.cc,etc.: Applied Lanica's PocketPC patches.

2007-06-16	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Makefile.common: Ensure that changes to "bgintrinsics.h" and "siintrinsics.h"
	will affect builds of Exult, UCC, WUD and WUC.

2007-06-15	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* effects.*, gameclk.*, palette.*, objs/egg.cc: Implemented missing weather:
	  snow, fog and overcast weather. Also changed rain to better match the
	  originals. Implemented smooth dawn/sunrise/sundown/dusk and smoother
	  transition to/from overcast/rain/snow/fog weather. Also, fixed bug
	  which prevented correct palette from being displayed after entering and
	  then leaving the cheat screen.
	* cheat_screen.cc, gamewin.cc: Reset weather to default before setting time.
	* objs/animate.cc, shapes/miscinf.*, data/*/shape_info.txt: Implemented
	  grandfather clock's horly "bongs". Implemented reading of animation data
	  from the original games, which is converted to the Exult format.
	  As a result, most of the animation data in data/*/shape_info.txt has been
	  rendered reduntant and is commented out, being left as examples of the
	  Exult format.
	  Changed the way extra delay between frames of an animation work to better
	  update object SFX, and likewise for pure SFX animators with random delays.
	* gumps/misc_buttons.cc: Fixed dumb error.
	* effects.cc, actors.cc, shapes/shapewrite.cc, shapes/shapeinf.*,
	  mapedit/shapeedit.cc: Changed missiles' "special behaviour" to "homing".
	* actors.cc, usecode/ucinternal.cc: Fixed bug which caused Dupre not to
	  appear in the conversation with Lord Marsten. Unfortunatelly, this means
	  that the animation bug fixed 2007-06-07 is now back.
	* monsters.cc: Monsters can also be pure SFX animators now (fixes bees).
	* actorio.cc: The original games did not store NPC's face shapes in npc.dat
	* usecode/ucinternal.cc: Unless passed an NPC object, show face equal to the
	  absolute value of the number passed from within usecode.
	* mapedit/exult_studio.glade: Fixed display of weather egg data.

2007-06-08	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Disabled fire sfx as it sounds awful.
	* Modified distance function to calculate distance between the center
	  tiles of the two objects.

2007-06-07	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed bug where nearby animations could temporarily stop if an "abort"
	  took place during a conversation.
	* More intrinsics uncovered with rip/wud/wuc:
	  BG: intrinsic 0x92 is *set_camera*, not center_view.
	      intrinsic 0x94 centers the screen around a (x, y) coordinate;
	          it has been renamed view_tile.
	  SI: intrinsic 0x19 is *get_item_weight*, not get_item_usability.
	      intrinsic 0x67 is definitelly remove_all_spells.
	      intrinsic 0x6b is stop_time.
	      intrinsic 0x70 is armageddon (yes, it is there).
	      intrinsic 0x72 is lightning.
	      intrinsic 0xb0 is view_tile.
	  Old center_view intrinsic is still available for both BG and SI.
	  Also, set_camera intrinsic also centers on objects, not just actors
	  SI intrinsics remove_all_spells, get_item_weight and get_skin_colour
	  were made available for BG too.
	* Updated/fixed a couple errors in intrinsic documentation.

2007-06-06    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* schedule.cc (Loiter_schedule): Rewrote miner-schedule to be more
	like the original.

2007-06-07	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Fixed bug when importing shp files into a VGA file over an existing shape.

2007-06-05	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed coastline desynch bug.
	* Fixed bug #1731542 by forcing the current frame to be passed for the
	  get_3d_xtiles get_3d_ytiles (thus, ensuring proper bounding boxes).
	* Fixed bug #1731543.
	* Fixed bug in ES method of saving differential VGA patches and improved
	  recognition of files from patch dir.

2007-06-03	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* objs/virtstone.h: Changed 'default' value for virtue stone map to be map 0.
	* objs/egg.cc: Fixed bug where sfx eggs would translate the SFX number to
	  the BG SFX, causing problems in SI.
	  De-hard-coded field data. Poison and sleep fields no longer activate if
	  the target is already poisoned/sleeping.
	* objs/objs.cc: Added some missing sfx when the avatar attacks an object.
	* shapes/miscinf.*, objs/*: Major work in object sfx; multiple objects can
	  now play the same sfx (as seen in the originals). Objects can now have
	  ranges (random or sequential) of sound effects, as well as sport a random
	  delay between each time the sfx is played.
	  New animation data and cycles unifies the way fields are handled with
	  every other animated object, including allowing them to have sfx. Also,
	  objects can have sfx synchronized with specific frames of the animation
	  (e.g., grandfather clocks) and can sport delays between each animation
	  cycle (e.g., bubbles).
	* shapes/miscinf.*: Modified to read new animation and SFX data.
	* gumps/misc_buttons.cc: Added missing button SFX.
	* data/*/shape_info.txt: Added tons of new sfx and animation data.
	* usecode/compiler/*:
	* actors.cc: Modified roll_to_win to better match statistical tests.
	  Added 'graze' and default 'hit' SFX. Modified NPCs to *really* be dormant
	  when in a different map from main actor.
	* effects.cc: SFX from weapon data should not be translated in SI.
	* exult.cc: Wizard_eye only blacks out area outside the original resolution;
	  this makes it work with SI even without the BG sprite 10 (as it in fact
	  happens in the original SI -- see the usecode changes below).
	* gamewin.cc: Fixed a bug(?) where clicking at the rock at [915, 2434, 0]
	  in BG would display 'key'. Might have unforeseen side effects.
	* audio/conv.cc: Fixed the BG-to-SI SFX table. The new data is based on the
	  MT-32 timbres from BG and SI SFX and on the assumption (apparently
	  correct) that BG SFX uses timbres equal to their SFX number, then matching
	  (by name) the timbres used by SI SFX.
	* usecode/*: New intrinsics discovered from original games with rip/wud/wuc:
	  BG: 0x2d: get_music_track
	      0x34: error_message
	  SI: 0x38: get_music_track
	      0x58: roll_to_win
	      0x5f: clone
	      0x61: display_area
	      0x62: wizard_eye
	      0xaf: get_dead_party
	  Note that several of these intrinsics were used in the originals.
	  Like wizard_eye intrinsic, display_area intrinsic also blacks out only
	  the area outside original resolution to work as the original SI did.
	  get_dead_party now searches around the object passed as the parameter
	  (which was ignored by Exult so far) instead of the avatar.
	  Added support for usecode functions with 32-bit IDs.
	* usecode/compiler/*: Added do-while support for UCC. Renamed return opcodes
	  to make them more intuitive. Added support for 32-bit function IDs, string
	  offsets and integers. 32-bit jump offsets are NOT implemented yet.
	  UCC directives are now more tolerant of white-space and (1) issue a
	  warning if the directive is unknown or (2) raise an error if there is no
	  new-line after a directive.
	* docs/exult_intrinsics.txt: Updated with new intrinsic information.
	* content/sifixes/*: Better 'make.bat'. Updated some files to make SI Fixes
	  actually compile with non-ancient versions of UCC.

2007-05-15    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* objs/egg.cc (public): Allow setting z-coord in teleport eggs.

2007-05-14	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* miscinf.cc: Fixed problem reading textmsg files with crlf's.
	* monsters.cc: Monsters with high shapes used wrong usecode function.

2007-04-28	Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* New sprite for male bucket-heade avatar, made by Skutarth. Also, removed
	  the silly fully-armored paperdoll for the bucket-headed avatars.

2007-04-15    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* imagewin/imagewin.cc (Image_window): Added Hq3x scaler.

2007-04-13    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* imagewin/hq2x.cc (srcx): Added Hq2x scaler.

2007-04-08  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed screwed-up palettes in SI mods with custom mainshp.flx files.
	* You can now add/change midi music by placing custom ADLIBMUS.DAT and/or
	  MT32MUS.DAT files in the patch dir.

2007-04-06  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Improved large-avatar handling, fixing a few bugs it introduced for
	  normal-sized avatars.
	* Improved Actor::Find_Blocking, and modified Actor::move_aside to check
	  the orthogonal directions first.
	* Improved slightly pace schedule.
	* Jukebox eggs now ignore delta-z when determining if they should hatch.

2007-04-04  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Improved skin scrolling functions.
	* ES now saves differential patches for VGA files. This will NOT affect
	  "patch" VGA files that already exist.
	* ES now exports to/imports from shp files into VGA files.

2007-04-02  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Avatar skins can now optionally specify whether or not the shape data
	  from the avatar's default skins will overwrite the shape data from the
	  skin's actual shape.
	* Versioning of text data files actually work now.
	* Better handling for movement of larger avatars.

2007-03-31  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Added new title screens for Keyring mod and SI Fixes.
	* Added build scripts/instructions for SI Fixes. Also, improved the Keyring
	  make scripts.
	* Added new avatars from Avatar Pack to Keyring mod.
	* You can now patch the keybindings on a per-mod basis. The Keyring mod has
	  been updated to reflect that.
	* Added partial support for patch music files. Ogg files in <PATCH>/music
	  will now be loaded (if they exist) instead of the corresponding ogg from
	  <MUSIC>. Still need to do the same for the midi/xmidi/etc.

2007-03-29  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Allow mainshp.flx patches. Also, slightly synched BG and SI new game code,
	and removed a few unnecessary palette changes in BG title screen.

2007-03-27  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	New vga/usecode generation scripts for Keyring mod.

2007-03-21    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* exult.cc: Fixed a couple bugs involving dragging NPC's onto the map.

2007-03-18  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* minsinf.cc: Made multiracial table patches actually be able to change
	  the built-in skins.
	* content/bgkeyring: changed storage method of graphics to shp files instead
	  of pngs and switched scripts to use expack instead of ipack. Added some
	  instructions on how to build the Keyring mod by yourself. Added several
	  new avatars to choose from, and improved existing ones. Removed generated
	  files (most vga files, the usecode file).

2007-01-15  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Don't print errors when looking for mods and the mods dir doesn't exist.

2007-01-10  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* A few bug fixes/improvements to the Keyring mod.

2007-01-06  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixing bug #1628256.

2007-01-02    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* mapedit/ucbrowse.cc (Usecode_browser): Sort columns in usecode
	browser.

2006-12-25  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	A few fixes/updates to the Keyring mod.

2006-12-24  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* miscinf.cc: Removing unneeded debug message.
	* ucbrowse: Lack of std::ios::binary in opening file caused wrong usecode
	  symbol table. Changed to use U7open instead of constructor.

2006-12-23    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* mapedit/shapeedit.cc: Added "Browse" buttons for usecode selection.

2006-12-20  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Increased version to 1.4.03CVS due to the enormous number of changes.
	* Added versioning information to the files loaded through Shapeinfo_lookup.
	* Added two new intrinsics: set_npc_name and set_usecode_fun, as well as
	  documentation for them.
	* shapes/miscinf.*: Added some new data files, with dynamic importing of
	  shapes allowed. See the data files themselves for more information.
	    ++++ Important ++++
	  These data files allow the specification of previously hard-coded data.
	  This hard-coded data will NO LONGER BE PRESENT for new games, which must
	  supply their own versions of the data files instead.
	* gamamgr/bggame.cc, sigame.cc: Updated to use new data files for skins.
	  In BG, also made the character creation screen use a new palette by using
	  palette remapping of the shapes to draw. Consequently, said screen uses
	  shapes from faces.vga (patched with Exult_bg.flx/mr_faces.vga) to draw
	  the multiracial faces.
	* expack.cc: You can now specify a shape number for a file in a script by
	  prefixing the file name with a ':shapenum:'. Shapes following a declared
	  shape will have their numbers assigned starting from the specified shape.
	* shapes/vgafile.*: VGA files now support multiple (more than 2) patches
	  from different sources. Also added support for loading VGA files from
	  within a flx file (such as Exult_bg.flx). Also, VGA files can now import
	  specific shapes from another VGA file and remap the shape number to a
	  different value. Finally, Shape frames can also be painted by remapping
	  their colors using a palette translation table.
	* shapeid.*: Renamed a few vars and functions to have more generic names.
	  Modified the handling of VGA file loading, allowing for independent use
	  of paperdolls and of multiracial avatars, as well as allowing multiple
	  patches for paperdol.vga in BG. BG shapes.vga now imports the multiracial
	  shapes from SI. Likewise, multiracial faces are patched into faces.vga.
	  Added support for drawing shapes by remapping them into another palette
	  using a translation table. Finally, BG gumps.vga imports the blue shapes
	  from the SI gumps.vga file.
	* shapes/shapevga.*: Modified info table to use a map instead.
	* gumps/Paperdoll_gump.cc: Use data-file-defined data for the blue shapes.
	* usecode/ucinternal.cc, conversation.cc: Use new data files and functions
	  to 'de-hack' multiracial support in BG. Also, the Petra and tattooed flags
	  also work in BG now, with effects configurable in data files.
	  Also, added function to retrieve a usecode function's name from its id.
	* usecode/ucserial.cc: Fixed bug #1616911.
	* cheat.cc, cheat_screen.cc: Use new functions for changing skin colors.
	  Allow use of naked, petra and tattooed flags in BG too.
	* palette.*: Added function to create a translation table between two palettes.
	  Improved find_color function to allow searching up to a specified index.
	* imagewin/ibuff8.*, shapes/font.*: Added support for painting shapes by
	  remapping their colors to another palette using a translation table.
	* actors.cc: Use new skin data and functions.
	* actorio.cc: Save/load skin color using its own char (but retain backward
	  compatibility).
	* all others: Changed for compatibility with the above changes.

2006-12-12  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed a bug in the get_class method of the symbol table.
	* Added a 'OVectorDataSource' vector data source for output of unknown
	  length to prevent problems with small buffers.
	* Made Usecode_value and Usecode_script classes use data sources for input
	  and output to eliminate possible buffer problems.
	* Removed the limit on usecode timers allowed.
	* Made usecode static vars refer to its parent function (if any) by name
	  when possible.

2006-12-11  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Added support for turning translucency on/off for paperdolls. New data for
	  BG and SI paperdolls has been added.
	* Fixed a couple goofs with new paperdoll art, and added some more art by
	  Crysta the Elf.
	* Loading a mod directly from the command line will no longer default to
	  the original game if the specified mod is not found or is not compatible
	  with the present Exult version.
	* Gave a much-needed version increase to Exult, particularly since the
	  paperdoll data it now expects is not backwards-compatible.

2006-12-11  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Added support for static usecode classes;
	* Compatibility update for Keyring mod with new BG paperdoll data.

2006-12-10  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Scripted steps now force the step to take place regardless of obstacles or
	  terrain (FoV & SS verified);
	* Changed handling of barges to allow movement type of barges above ground
	  level to 'MOVE_LEVITATE' (FoV & SS verified).
	* Adding more BG paperdoll art by Crysta the Elf.

2006-12-09  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Adding tons of new paperdoll graphics for BG by Crysta. Also removed
	  unneeded file.
	* Improved UCXT data files and intrinsic table.
	* Improved WUD/WUC opcode table and fixed a few errors.

2006-12-08  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixing a few stack corruption bugs in UCC.
	* Changing wud/wuc name of opcode 0x5C.

2006-12-07  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Changing the way Exult handles the game clock. Now, the game clock 'ticks'
	  25 times per game minute, regardless of FPS, which seems to be the way it
	  worked in the original.
	* Sime improvements to the 'pace' schedule.
	* NPC schedules now update every hour, and look back until it finds a
	  schedule for the NPC.
	* Added a 'continue' statement in UCC for 'while' and 'for' statements.
	* Fixed a few bugs and updated a few things in the Keyring mod. Added new
	  Mariah gump by Crysta.

2006-12-06  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* actors.*, intrinsics.cc, ucsched.cc, ucparse.yy, exult_intrinsics.txt:
	  Implemented damage type parameter of 'apply_damage' and 'reduce_health'
	  intrinsics and of the 'hit' script opcode. Also implemented the red flash
	  for lighting damage for even a single hit, as it happened in the original,
	  as well as flashign red for high amounts of damage.
	  Also implemented 'repeat2' support in UCC.
	* everything else: Fixing bugs in the mods and updating them to use the
	  changes above.

2006-12-05  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Adding new 'is_dest_reachable' intrinsic and documentation for it.

2006-12-04  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Updating documentation of [get|set|clear]_item_flag intrinsics.
	* Fixed bug #1608149.

2006-12-02  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Fixing Keyring bugs in forging code/Menion's training.

2006-11-30  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	When editing shape info, have origin be updated when the frame is changed.

2006-11-29  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Updating Keyring mod to incorporate some additions to UCC, as well as a new
	  sprite and gump for Mariah and several bugfixes.

2006-11-28  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* shapeid.*, actors.cc: 'paralyze' flag now displays a purple outline. For
	  the sake of visibility, the SI color was used instead of the BG one.
	* exult.*, usecode/conversation.cc, usecode/ucinternal.cc: Rotate palette
	  colors during conversations and during book mode (U7 verified -- e.g., the
	  SI phoenix).
	* usecode/bgintrinsics.h: Imported five intrinsics from SI to BG:
	  show_npc_face0, show_npc_face1, remove_npc_face0, remove_npc_face1 and
	  set_conversation_slot.
	* usecode/siintrinsics.h: Imported three intrinsics from BG to SI:
	  center_view, lightning and stop_time.
	* docs/exult_intrinsics.txt: Included above modifications.

2006-11-26  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Fixed Karnax freeze-up bug.

2006-11-24  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* UCC: Adding assignment operators ('+=', '-=', '*=', '/=', '%='); improved
	  the functionality of '<<'; allowing getting/setting global flags with
	  non-constant expressions; allowing non-constant values in 'actor frame'
	  script command; fixed crash on code like 'var test = fun();' with 'fun'
	  undeclared; some misc improvements.
	* Exult: Added two new opcodes that allow getting/setting flags using a
	  value on the stack.

2006-11-23  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* ufcun.h: Fixing UCC bug that caused first obj.say or obj.hide calls to do
	  fail do perform their intrinsic calls if they were the first intrinsic-
	  related calls in a usecode file.
	* All others: Adding C++-style switch statement to UCC.
	* Minor optimization for integer constants in UCC.

2006-11-21  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Adding extra capabilities to UI_book_mode_ex intrinsic, as well as improved
	documentation for it.

2006-11-21  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Adding two new intrinsics: UI_book_mode_ex and UI_display_map_ex, as
	well as documentation for both.

2006-11-17  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* docs/exult_intrinsics.txt: Reformatting file, some other minor fixes.

2006-11-05  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* ucinternal.cc: Fixed possible stack corruption on usecode machine when
	  getting/setting global flags. Also, for testing, make opcode 0x2d (setr)
	  display pending text.
	* exult.cc: Made --buildmap option work once again, now with support for
	  all games and mods.
	* usecode/compiler/ucfun.cc: Usecode functions which specify a return value
	  use the UC_RTS return instead of UC_RET at the end of the function.
	* usecode/compiler/*.*: Added support for comparison of multiple strings in
	  a converse case block. Syntax is:
			case "test1", "test2":
	  and adding the '(remove)' option causes all the options to be removed.
	  The UCC script command 'call' now accepts variables for the eventid to use.
	  Also added new scripting options with the intent to completelly phase out
	  the execute_usecode_array and delayed_execute_usecode_array intrinsics.
	  Scripts can now be created like this:
		var varname1 = new script { // script commands };
	  and can be added to like this:
		varname1 << varname2;
		varname1 << { // script commands };
	  The '<<' operator will append the right-hand side to the var on the left-
	  hand side, and can be chained; e.g.,
		varname1 << varname2 << { // script commands };
	  results in the same script as the above two lines. Finally, the calls to
	  execute_usecode_array and delayed_execute_usecode_array intrinsics can be
	  done respectivelly with
		'actor.run_script(script);'
	  and
		'actor.run_script(script, delay);'
	  The previous UCC script blocks still work as they used to.

2006-09-25  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* schedule.cc: Fixed pace schedule for large creatures (such as the cyclops
	  northeast of Cove).
	* actors.cc: Map-edit mode now delays handle_events for actors, preventing
	  almost all actions. Also, fixed the bg_dont_move condition in
	  in_usecode_control function.
	* egg.*: Fixed field/caltrop bugs on editing/updating from ES, as well as
	  bug #1564529.

2006-09-24  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Implemented monster attack SFX; verified in the originals.

2006-09-22  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* ucsched.cc, actors.*, gamewin.cc: Looking at 'no_halt' script opcode in
	  a slightly different way. In particular, this prevents silver serpent
	  venom from freezing the user for 1 game hour.
	* ucsym.h: Fixed a GCC 4 compile problem.
	* keys.cc: Changed a few identing spaces to tabs.

2006-09-22  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Reduced avatar's speed to prevent outrunning of the teleport storm at the
	  start of SI. The reulting speed also seems to match the original games
	  better, as it is now very hard to outrun enemies. The avatar's speed is
	  also reduced if it is in a (delayed) usecode script, which helps to
	  prevent outrunning the teleport storm without making the avatar too slow
	  while in combat mode. Also, switched a few identing spaces to tabs.
	* Preventing player from moving avatar during the execution of scripts; this
	  is verified in BG and SI (for example, loom or bellows); delayed scripts do
	  not seem to hinder movement until they are activated.
	* Prevent ES from displaying the 'font0000.vga' file in SI's static dir as it
	  is apparently from an old origin screensaver and is not a true vga file.
	* Fixed bug causing avatar's 'rest_time' to build up too fast. Incidentally,
	  this helps to fix a jerkiness in scripts introduced in previous commits.
	  Also, script opcode 'delay' and any scripted frame changes or steps now will
	  clear the rest time for actors.
	* Fixed problem in Windows builds with USE_EXULTSTUDIO option which caused
	  excessive processor usage, as well as being indirectly responsible for the
	  rapid build-up of the avatar's 'rest_time'.
	* The files 'paperdoll_info.txt', 'bodies.txt' and 'shape_info.txt' (and
	  similar files in the future -- and with the exception of the files bundled
	  the Exult_XX.flx files) no longer require declaration of all sections to be
	  properly parsed.

2006-09-21  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Decoupled usecode functions for shapes > 1023 from the shape #. Removed
	  ucfunids.h since it is no longer needed. In UCC, you now must specify
	  the function to be used for a given shape by declaring the function
	  with the 'shape#(n)' construct in its header; for shapes < 1024, you can
	  still get away by declaring it with a normal function # instead. If *no*
	  functions are declared with 'shape#(n)' or if the usecode was compiled with
	  an earlier version of UCC, the old behaviour will be in effect in Exult.
	* New NPCs can now specify a function name as their usecode function. New
	  save games will not work in older versions of Exult, but old saves will
	  still work.
	* Fixed a couple differences in conversation behaviour between Exult and
	  the original games.
2006-09-20  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Working on UCC classes. Added inheritance support, class instantiation in
	  UCC, type checking for class casts, changed method of class creation and
	  deletion and added support for method calls with and without scope
	  resolution operator (to allow calling of overriden inherited functions).
	  Classes can be passed as parameters to functions and be returned by
	  functions, with full type checking; a '0' can be returned as a class
	  return. Methods can also return values now (including classes) but class
	  data members cannot be classes themselves yet.
	  Added static and global static classes and fixed bug preventing the
	  following code from working correctly unless item == npc:
			npc->set_item_frame(1+get_item_frame());
	  Got static arrays working correctly in loops and in setting/retrieving
	  their elements.
	  Possible future enhancements: add a way to set/retrieve class variables
	  from outside a class; maybe allow class data members to be classes.
	* Modified handling of '#' directives in UCC so they don't disrupt the line
	  numbering.
	* In Keyring mod: Fixed a few missing vars in function headers and a few
	  missing parameters in function calls. Also, updated Paperdoll_info.txt and
	  bodies.txt to include only the new paperdoll/body information.
	* In SI Fixes mod: Removed wrong parameter from function definition.

2006-09-17  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* shapes/bodies.*, gumps/Paperdoll_gump_info.cc: Removed files, code
	  moved to miscinf.*.
	* gumps/Paperdoll_gump.cc: For ammo, use 'frame2' instead of 'frame'
	  when a compatible weapon is in hand. Also, see below.
	* actors.cc: 'step' should do nothing for non-party members when in
	  map-edit mode. Also, see below.
	* gumps/Face_button.cc, gumps/Face_stats.cc, gumps/Paperdoll_gump.*,
	  objs/animate.cc, actors.cc, effects.cc, gamewin.cc, gamemap.cc,
	  shapes/miscinf.*, usecode/ucinternal.cc, msvc_kludges.h, shapes/Makefile.am,
	  gumps/Makefile.am, Makefile.common: Clean up and centralization of code from
	  miscinf.* and old shapes/bodies.* and gumps/Paperdoll_gump_info.cc. Also,
	  the paperdol_info.txt, bodies.txt and shape_info.txt data files no longer
	  completelly override those from Exult_XX.flx (for BG and SI) or from static
	  dir (for new games).

2006-09-07  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* usecode/ucinternal.cc: Increased the maximum number of intrinsics to 1024.
	* usecode/ucinternal.h: A identing spaces to tabs, some align tabs to spaces.

2006-09-07  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	content/sifixes/*/*.uc: CRLF->LF.

2006-09-06  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* In General: Changed a spaces in identation to tabs.
	* gamewin.cc: When starting a game using '--edit', have time be stopped
	  right from the start.
	* exult_constants.h: Defined c_max_shapes and c_occsize for better support
	  of shapes >1023; defined c_last_gflag for better support of global usecode
	  flags >1023.
	* cheat_screen.cc, usecode/ucmachine.h: Use c_last_gflag instead of '2047'
	  for last global usecode flag.
	* All others: Added support for shapes>1023 to 'occludes.dat'. Shapes are
	  now limited by c_max_shapes instead of 2048, making it easier to increase
	  the limit if it is needed.
	* content/bgkeyring/src/misc/food_stuff/functions.uc: Fixed bug while eating
	  garlic introduced after Q&I was merged in.

2006-09-04  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* game.cc: Starting a game with a mod resulted in wrong mod identification
	  in stdout.
	* mapedit/studio.cc, server/server.cc, server/servewin32.cc: In Windows, use
	  gamedat dir instead of static dir to allow simultaneous editing of two mods
	  that share the same static path (non-Windows already do that).

2006-09-01  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* audio/midi_drivers/LowLevelMidiDriver.cpp : Improving termination code 
	  for threaded midi drivers
	* server/servemsg.cc, server/server.cc, server/servewin32.cc : Rewrote 
	  Exult<->ExultStudio communications to use a socket in Windows. Should be
	  much more stable
	* Other cc files fixing up some 'const' (or lack there of) problems

2006-08-31  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* shapelst.cc, shapelst.h: The Gimp would fail to load a frame if the
	  game's path in exult.cfg was a relative path. Also, added the ability
	  to export and import all frames of a given shape to/from pngs.

2006-08-29  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* chunks.cc, objs.o: Fixed map corruption bug when dragging chunks from ES.
	  Also, prevent map changes when removing terrain objects if nodel is true,
	  and correctly check for map cache out when moving terrain objects.

2006-08-27  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Makefile.common: Fixed UCC compile problem in MinGW.
	* content/bgkeyring/*/*: Merged in the 'Iteractions' part of Alun Bestor's
	  Quests & Iteractions mod into the Keyring mod. Added generic healing
	  services (used by all healers), Lord British's Crown Jewels and updated
	  the code to use newer features of UCC. Also added casting frames for all
	  caster NPCs and changed some crlfs to lfs.
	* objs/objs.*: Fixed map corruption bug when moving chunk non-flat objects.

2006-08-24    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* schedule.cc,readnpcs.cc,actors.cc:  Working on support for
	usecode-scripted schedules.  Also did some cleanup on schedule
	reading/writing.
	(Eat_at_inn_schedule): No more annoying delay before inn customers
	take their seats.

2006-08-22  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* actions.cc: Testing adding a limit to the number of steps between each
	  check in Approach_actor_action (makes for smarter archers and monsters).
	* effects.cc: Removed some duplicate increments in height for projectiles
	  and slightly tweaked the start and end positions for them.

2006-08-21  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Makefile.common: Force recreation of ucparse.{cc,h} or uclex.cc if,
	  respectively, ucparse.yy or uclex.yy are changed. Need to know if
	  it causes compilation problems in MorphOS or BeOS. Also removed some
	  trailing spaces.

2006-08-20  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed compilation problems caused by modmgr by moving files bggame.*,
	  sigame.*, devgame.* and modmgr.* into new 'gamemgr' directory.

2006-08-14  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* modmgr.cc: Added two path macros to mod cfg files: '__MODS__' and
	  '__MOD_PATH__'. They are expanded, respectivelly, to the game's '<MODS>'
	  dir and to the mod's '<MODS>/<mod_title>' (where '<mod_title>' is the
	  mod's cfg option, defaulting to the filename -- sans extension -- of
	  said cfg).
	* schedule.cc: Slightly tweaked the 'talk' schedule. NPCs will no longer
	  try to talk through mountains.
	* ucsym.*, ucparse.yy, ucfun.h: Fixed bug #1540599. Now, declaring functions
	  through externs and directly will always assign the same function number
	  in both cases (and regardless of order) as long as both have the same
	  number of parameters (and whether or not autonumbering -- either style --
	  is being used). Duplicate declarations (but not duplicate externs, unless
	  the parameter count differs) will raise errors now.

2006-08-14  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Setting bg_dont_move and dont_move flags prevent actors from doing any
	  schedule actions while the flag is set.

2006-08-13  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* objs.cc: Fixed cache-out bug of terrain objects when the whole map is cached
	  out (mostly when teleporting to another map).
	* exult.cc, exultmenu.cc: Fixed a palette problem when loading a game with
	  command-line parameters with 'skip_splash' disabled. Also, fixed the initial
	  Exult logo in the menu.
	* modmgr.cc: Remove trailing slashes before adding "<MODS>" system path for
	  each game.

2006-08-08  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* exult.cc, exultmenu.cc: Added a Zaurus version of the menu -- single
	  column, only 3 games/mods per page and no Exult logo in the back (as it
	  interferes with menu) -- due to resolution constraints. Also fixed dumb
	  mistake when loading a game with --bg or --si.

2006-08-07  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Adding mod manager to Exult and Exult Studio. New Exult menu now displays
	  all games in exult.cfg and has a sub-menu for each game's mods. Likewise,
	  Exult Studio can load games and mods. In some of the files, converted some
	  identation spaces into tabs, and some trailing spaces were removed.
	Detailed information:
	* modmgr.*: New classes that (1) manage the game list, (2) manage each
	  game's mods and (3) store information for each game/mod and correctly
	  sets path information when needed. Games have their own entries in
	  exult.cfg (with the additional "title" tag containing the string to
	  display in the Exult menu), while mods have their own drop-in cfg files
	  located in "<MODS>/*.cfg". The "<MODS>" directory is configurable for
	  each game in exult.cfg (with the new "<mods>" tag), but defaults to
	  "<path>/mods".
	* menulist.*: New text-based menu entry classes replacing the shape-based
	  ones (except for the MenuEntry, also referenced in game.cc, due to palette
	  concerns) and added menu IDs to entries.
	* exult.*: Command-line loading of mods with "--mod <mod>", modified loading
	  of games to use classes from modmgr; moved some functions to modmgr.*;
	  added "<MODS>" system path configurable in exult.cfg; Exult will now be
	  centered in Windows when not in full-screen mode to prevent window
	  being partially offscreen.
	* game.*, bggame.*, sigame.*, devgame.*: Moved is_installed to modmgr.*,
	  modified game creation to use modmgr.*, mod used is reported in stdout,
	  initial game uses new menu IDs.
	* exultmenu.*: The new menus mentioned above.
	* exult0.pal, *.shp, flx.in: Removed old menu shapes and added fonts for them.
	* cheat.cc: Map-editing loads Exult Studio using the current game and mod.
	* studio.*, exult_studio.glade: Loading of games and mods via dialogs,
	  loading of mods via command line with "-m <mod>" and creation of new
	  mods via dialog. Uses the classes from modmgr.*
	* makefile.*: Added modmgr.*, modified list of *.shp's used.

	  to use the item type instead of shape number.

2006-06-11 Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* midi/audio_drivers/mt32emu/i386.cpp: sync with scummvm to make it

	  they are set when an NPC is attacked instead of when it is hurt.
	  Additionally, the avatar will now set the 'blocked' vector if it is
	  moving due to a schedule.
	* actors.cc, usecode/bgintrinsics.h: Allowed several more SI intrinsics
	  for BG; specifically, the intrinsics add_cont_items, clear_item_say,
	  save_pos, teleport_to_saved_pos, set_camera, set_polymorph and
	  infravision can now be used in BG games.
	* usecode/intrinsics.cc: Added reminder to look into 'approach_avatar'
	  intrinsic (seems to actually be 'create_offscreen', but I need to do
	  some further tests to be sure).
	* docs/exult_intrinsics.txt: Full intrinsic documentation describing
	  them as they are implemented in Exult. ALL intrinsics are documented.

2006-03-05    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* objs/egg.cc,etc.: Usecode eggs may be given a function name
	instead of a number.

2006-02-28  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>

	  and 'Pace vertical' schedules to better match original games.

2006-02-27  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* BG Keyring Mod and SI Fixes are now licensed under the GNU GPL.
	* For the BG Keyring Mod, I also modified a bit the NPC spellcasting
	  items and routines, and started work in a spellcasting pseudo-AI.

2006-02-26  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>

	  previously.

2006-02-12  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	Round 1 of de-hard-coding data from Exult.
	* actors.cc: Added support for custom BG-style gumps. Eliminated
	  the hard-coded data about which items get usecode ready/unready
	  events.
	* bggame.cc, sigame.cc: Two new resources in the respective flx
	  files.
	* cheat.cc, cheat_screen.cc: NPCs with mana should recover/be able
	* data/*/*: New de-hard-coded data, and mpdified flx.in files to
	  add them to the correct game flx file.
	* effects.cc: The association shape <> explosion sprite has been
	  moved out.
	* files/msgfile.cc: Lines starting with a ':' will be sequentially
	  auto-indexed.
	* gumps/Face_button.cc, Face_stats.cc: Removed restrictions on
	  which NPCs display faces in the status bar. Also, NPCs with
	  non-zero magic will display a mana bar.
	* gumps/Gump_manager.cc, Gump_manager.h, Paperdoll_gump.h: Added
	  support for BG-style gumps.
	* gumps/Paperdoll_gump.cc: Removed references to old paperdoll
	  data from the file.
	* gumps/Paperdoll_gump_info.cc: Externalized all paperdoll data.
	* keyactions.cc: Support for custom BG-style gumps.
	* server/server.cc, mapedit/exult_studio.glade, npcedit.cc: Added
	  the ability to display an actor's gump from the edit window.
	  Also modified a few things in shape edit window in preparation
	  for adding editing capabilities for newly exported data.
	* objs/chunks.cc: Removed hard-coded data about 'mountain tops'.
	  Seems to work OK.
	* objs/animate.cc, animate.h: Shape <> sfx and shape <> animation
	  info have been moved out.
	* shapes/miscinf.h, miscinf.cc, makefile.am: New file for
	  loading/retrieving the newly de-hard-coded data.
	  to edit it with cheats.
	* shapes/bodies.cc, bodies.h: Deleted the old bodies table,
	  externalized the data in the Is_Body function.

2006-02-08    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* schedule.cc (Waiter_schedule): Improvements to this schedule.

2006-02-07  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>

2006-02-04  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* effects.cc: fix crash for missile without weapon info
	* actors.cc: uninitialized variable

2006-02-04  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Corrected the workings of UI_is_readied and UI_get_readied based
	  on the original games.

2006-02-04  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* objs/objs.*: removed strange ifdefs around certain functions

2006-02-03  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Reorganized BG Keyring Mod with use of new autonumbering system.
	* Modified SI Fixes to use new autonumbering system.

2006-02-03  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* files/databuf.h: StreamDataSource::eof() returns eof before actually
	  having read past the end of file, to make this behave consistently
	  with the other DataSources
	* files/msgfile.*: allow reading text file from DataSource
	* shapes/bodies.cc: read bodies_bg/si from .flx files
	* data/*: moved bodies_bg/si to exult_bg/si.flx

2006-02-03  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* ucparse.yy: Added a way to retrieve the assigned number of a
	  given function. Used like this:
		//If function_name is a defined function, fun will
		//have the correct function number:
		var fun = &function_name;
		//Call function_name indirectly:
		(*fun)();
	* uclex.ll, ucsym.*: Added new '#autonumber' directive to UCC.
	  It turns on 'smart' autonumbering of functions from a given
	  initial value and *ignores* functions with preset function
	  numbers. For example:
		#autonumber 0xC00
		fun1 0xD00 () {/* Code here */}
		fun2 () {/* Code here */}
		fun3 0xA00 () {/* Code here */}
		fun4 () {/* Code here */}
	  This results in fun2 and fun4 having numbers 0xC00 and 0xC01,
	  respectivelly. If the directive is not used, the default
	  ("old-style") autonumbering will be in effect.

2006-02-02  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Added a custom body for Laurianna in the 'BG Keyring Mod'.
	* bodies.cc: Removed checks against old tables.

	  create_new_object2.

2006-02-01  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Updating 'SI Fixes' and 'BG Keyring Mod' to use the new #game
	  UCC compiler directive.

2006-02-01    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* usecode/compiler/uclex.ll,etc.:  Added '#game "blackgate"' and
	'#game "serpentisle"' directives to set intrinsics at top of ucc
	source file.  

2006-01-28  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed but with teleport (not intermap) eggs in multimap
	  games.

2006-01-29    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* actors.cc,npcnear.cc,objs.h:  Stop schedules of NPC's who are
	off the current map.

2006-01-28  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed a few bugs for objects with shape # >1023.

2006-01-28  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* cheat_screen.cc: The 'Teleport to NPC' function now moves you
	  to the correct map.
	* objs.h: Added a 'shortcut' get_map_num() member function for
	  easier retrieval of an object's current map.
	* intrinsics.cc, ucinternal.h, bgintrinsics.h, siintrinsics.h:
	  Added intrinsic get_map_num.
	* All files but the header files: Modified to use get_map_num().

2006-01-23  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* gamedat.cc, gamedat.h: Fixed saving and loading multimap saves
	  with level 2 zip compression. The fix uses internal mapXX files
	  (similar in structure to the GAMEDAT file used for the default
	  map) to store the files in <GAMEDAT>/mapXX dirs. Still need to
	  fix the flex saves for multimap capabilities (tagged with a
	  'TODO:').
	* gamewin.cc: Fixing a rare crash when changing maps followed by
	  F3 teleport.

2006-01-22    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* schedule.cc: Improved 'talk' schedule so that NPC won't talk
	until close, and will call to you like in the original.

2006-01-22  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* gamedat.cc: Improved the previous fix to make it safer. Note
	  that level 2 compression is still incompatible with multimaps
	  (or, for that matter, so are the flex saves). I am still trying
	  to work out a way to fix that *and* keep compatibility with older
	  saves; relevant sections are tagged with a 'TODO:'. Any takers?
	* gamewin.cc: Fixed bug in loading of multimap games. Basically,
	  only map #0 would be loaded, causing data loss when saving maps
	  or games unless the player visited the other maps.
	* actors.cc: approach_another now moves NPCs to the correct
	  destination map before trying to pathfind.
	
2006-01-21  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* actors.cc: Fixed resurrection bug -- using (e.g.) Death Bolt
	  resulted in a body which would not be resurrected, unlike what
	  happened in the original.
	* gamedat.cc: Fixed errors on restoring from multimap savegame
	  or initgame.
	
2006-01-20  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* usecode/intrinsics.cc: Virtue stones should use the map number
	  they are in, not of the map being displayed.

2006-01-14    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* exult.cc: "Combo" selection is now done with single-clicking or
	dragging.  Shapes added are selected, and one can toggle by
	holding down the Control key.  Flat tiles are no longer added.

2006-01-07  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Fixed cache-out bug which prevented eggs from reseting when
	  teleporting between maps.
	* usecode/intrinsics.cc: Multimap support for display_area
	  intrinsic.

2006-01-06  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* gamedat.cc: Checking for the existance of ireg files before saving
	  them to zip files prevents crashes when saving new maps for existing
	  games.
	* gamemap.cc, objs/virtstone.*, usecode/intrinsics.cc, ucinternal.*:
	  Added multimap support to the following intrinsics:
		update_last_created & move_object (if the location is a 4-element
		array, the 4th element is the map #);
		mark_virtue_stone & recall_virtue_stone (now save/restore the map #);
		save_pos & teleport_to_saved_pos (now save/restore the map #).
	  Virtue stones from older save games still work, and so will (I hope)
	  the saved positions from older SI saves.

2006-01-03  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* actors.h: get_usecode now returns correct value for NPCs with no
	  assigned usecode *and* with a shape# >1023.
	* objs.h: added a virtual get_usecode function which returns correct
	  usecode function for a given shape.
	* usecode/intrinsics.cc, etc.: added new intrinsic to get an object's
	  usecode function number via usecode (mostly to allow the calling of
	  an item's usecode given an item reference to that item).
	  
2005-12-29  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>

	* configure.ac, debian/, Makefile.am: Removing the debian directory,
	as requested by the debian package maintainer

2005-10-02    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* actorio.cc: Save/restore 2-byte face#.

2005-10-01    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* exult.cc: Watch for game names "blackgate" and "serpentisle".

	* objs/egg.cc (Egg_object): Fixed crash when dropping an egg on
	something else.

2005-08-21    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* gumps/Stats_gump.cc (Stats_gump): Display 'extra' attributes
	defined in usecode.

	* mapedit/shapelst.cc: Fixed bug when importing from Gimp where
	transparency would go away.

2005-08-10    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* actors.h (public): get_attributes() returns list of all
	attribute/value pairs.

	* usecode/intrinsics.cc: get_npc_prop/set_npc_prop can get/set
	generic attributes if you pass a name as the property.

2005-08-06  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Changed the way BG paperdolling is handled to use a 'paperdol.vga' file.
	  Paperdoll patches are now possible in BG too.

2005-08-02    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* shapes/bodies.cc: Use text files for getting body shapes.

2005-07-24    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* usecode/ucinternal.cc: In SI, 'path_run_usecode' should have the
	companions follow (fixes ice-raft).

	* actions.cc (std): At end of path-walking, gather up followers.

	* actors.cc,drag.cc:  Call readied/unreadied usecode in more

2005-07-17    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* combat.cc: Improvements to weapon-readying so that monsters are
	better-equipped. 

2005-07-17  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* gamewin.cc: Fixed small bug with dont_move flag in BG.
	* intrinsics.cc: Allowed bg_dont_move flag to work like SI's dont_move flag
	  when it is toggled (i.e., take Avatar out of combat mode). Also allowed
	  invisible flag to be set for all objects.
	* objs.cc: Fixed small bug which prevented detection of invisible objects
	  with find_nearby using mask 0x20.

2005-07-16  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* actors.cc: Fixed crash when there was no attacker.
	* intrinsics.cc: Fixed real cause of the super-cannon bug -- LOOP opcode
	  should not loop if the variable hasn't been initialized (verified in the
	  original, but with the add-ons only).
	* objs.cc, effects.cc: Undid one change in each which became unnecessary now
	  that the real cause of the super-cannon bug has been found. Also, slightly
	  tweaked Projectile_effect for the benefit of traps.

2005-07-15    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* usecode/ucinternal.cc: Added support for indirect calls.
	Example:
	var fun = fun1;
	(*fun)(3);
	fun = fun + 1;
	(*fun)(17);

2005-07-15  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* actors.cc: Fixed bug I introduced in which dueling NPCs would slaughter
	  each other and then attack the avatar.
	* objs.cc, objs.h: Fixed bug I introduced about container hit points.
	* effects.cc: Changed to use the new get_effective_obj_hp function.
	* animate.cc: Added a few new shape sound effects.

2005-07-13  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* game.cc: fix crashing german BG (its IDENTITY is "ULTIMA7")

2005-07-11  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* mapedit/studio.h, etc: Implemented game detection code and ready spots.
	  I am trusting exult.cfg to be accurate, which I am not sure is wise :-)
	* objs.cc, etc: In fixing the cannon, I broke the Test of Virtue. Both work
	  now. Powderkegs are now dangerous to attack, as in the original.

2005-07-10  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* shapes/shapeinf.h, mapedit/exult_studio.glade, shapeedit.cc: Corrected
	  damage type (from 'poison' to 'lightning') and added two other damage
	  types ('ethereal' and 'sonic') and immunities -- both of which are used
	  in BG, but not in SI. Also, left shapeedit.cc pratically ready to get
	  'ready spots' working (it does for BG already).
	* actors.cc: Implemented immunities/vulnerabilities. Also allowed actors
	  with cant_die flag to appear to be wounded (flash with red outline), as
	  in the original. Last, prevented party members from calling the guards if
	  they die because of the Avatar.

2005-07-09    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* mapedit/npclst.cc (Npc_chooser): Added NPC browser.

2005-07-10  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* mapedit/exult_studio.glade, shapeedit.cc: New info from weapons.dat and
	  ammo.dat can now be edited in Exult Studio. Also, modified the 'ready spot'
	  menu from 'Shape Info' window in preparation to getting it to work.
	* content/sifixes/resurrect.uc: Fixed resurrection bug when target NPC was
	  alive but in the House of the Dead.

2005-07-08  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Implemented missile rotation and speed, using data from weapons.dat; this
	  data is now saved and loaded correctly.
	* Modified the animation speed of attacks; it now uses get_std_delay to
	  determine speed.
	* Modified very slightly the way attack frames are handled.
	* Fixed initialization bug of casting frames.

2005-07-05  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Allow si_tournament to be used in BG. Also, introduced bg_dont_move
	  flag for BG, which works like dont_move does in SI. Finally, updated
	  the cheat screen's flag names to reflect the flag names as they are
	  defined in "flags.h".
	* Implemented the use of casting frames when casting spells. Also added
	  a new intrinsic called 'begin_casting_mode' which activates the use of
	  casting frames for a given NPC (added mostly for scripting purposes).

2005-07-05  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Modified the SI Fixes source files to use the new intrinsic calling
	  method ('->'). Also, removed duplicate (unused) files.
	* actors.cc: NPCs should only react if the weapon actually does something
	  to them.

2005-07-05    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>
	* usecode/compiler/*.{cc,h}: Allow intrinsics to be called as
	'methods', so that the following are equivalent:
		c = UI_get_item_flag(item, 10);
		c = item->get_item_flag(10);
		c = get_item_flag(10);

2005-07-03  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* Modified detection of 'delayed blast' projectile, as it was too inclusive
	  before. I also am interpreting its lack of projectile data to mean it
	  should not be rendered. This matches the original.
	* Modified the way SI sleep arrows work to better match the original.

2005-07-04  Ryan Nunn  <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* exult.cc : Ensure Audio is deinitialized on exit
	* audio/midi_drivers/LowLevelMidiDriver.cpp, 
	  audio/midi_drivers/XMidiFile.cpp : Small changes to MT32 display handling

2005-07-03    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* When equipping monsters, give them ammo for their weapons.
	* When an NPC can't pathfind to an enemy in combat, just let him
	wander a short way towards the enemy before retrying.

2005-07-03  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* actors.cc, shapes/shapeinf.h: Modified constant names and used them for attack
	  frames. Also changed the default attack sequence for when there is no weapon.
2005-07-03  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* actors.cc, shapes/shapeinf.h: Implemented weapon-dependent frame sequences
	  for attacks
	* effects.cc, effects.h: Slightly modified the way burst arrows are handled,
	  eliminated some hard-coded data about explosion sizes and moved the definition
	  of Get_explosion_shape out of Explosion_effect class.
2005-07-02  Marzo Sette Torres Junior <marzojr@yahoo.com>
	* shapes/shapeinf.cc, etc: Added capabilities to read/save some previously
	  unknown data from ammo.dat and fixed minor bug on saving weapons.dat
	* effects.cc: Modified to use newly decoded ammo.dat info, modified Death
	  Vortex to more closely resemble original and implemented Energy Mist (the
	  latter two share the same code)
	* actors.cc: Modified how explosives work on hit; includes modifications for
	  Death Vortex and Energy Mist; now uses new ammo.dat info to determine if
	  missiles should be dropped on hit/miss.
	* content/sifixes (several): Prevent Serpent Bond from smuggling companions
	  to Dream World in SI

2005-07-01  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>

	  audio/midi_drivers/Makefile.am, audio/midi_drivers/MidiDriver.cpp : 
	  New FluidSynthMidiDriver borrowed from ScummVM. Needs FluidSynth to

	* Big changes to the way music is handled internally
	* OGG Vorbis support no longer replaces Midi support
	* MT32 Sysex is now supported
	* Added All Pentagram Midi Drivers
	* Added 'mt32emu' Midi Driver. Needs USE_MT32EMU_MIDI defined, and 
	  needs files "MT32_CONTROL.ROM" and "MT32_PCM.ROM" to be placed
	  in the Exult data directory to work (where the files are needed
	  might be changed). This is not compiled by default.
	* Removed some midi drivers.
	* Attempted to update midi drivers so they will compile
	* The "none" Midi Conversion option is now "mt32" and is used to 
	  specify that the device should be treated as a real mt32 device.
	  Effect: No patch conversion and will send sysex
	* New Midi Conversion option "fakemt32" to specify the device as a 
	  device is not a real mt32, but uses mt32 patches.
	  Effect: No patch conversion and will NOT send sysex
	* New config key "config/audio/midi/use_oggs" to specify if to use
	  ogg vorbis digital music
	* Audio options gump modified. 'Midi Conversion' option changed to
	  'Device Type'
	* And probably countless other things too that i can't remember at 
	  this time

2004-01-03    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* gamerend.cc,chunks.cc:  Handle dungeons slightly differently to
	avoid black squares in SI Sunrise Isle area.  I'm assuming a

	'gather' when we've actually add/deleted/moved an object.

	* objs/egg.cc (Egg_object): Teleport eggs should not automatically

	* cheat_screen.cc: don't show unimplemented options

2003-11-12  Ryan Nunn  <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* tools/u7voice2syx.cc : Small tool that will convert various files 
	  ("u7voice.flx" BG, "u7intro.tim" BG, and "mainmenu.tim" SI) into syx 
	  (SysEx) format files for people with MT32s. For everyone else these 
	  files are kinda useless. Doesn't do anything with the XMIDI.MT files
	  which are used for the BG endgame xmis, and the SI intro, in game and
	  endgame xmis.

2003-11-09  Ryan Nunn  <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* exultmenu.cc, gamewin.cc, audio/Midi.*, audio/xmidi.*,
	  gumps/AudioOptions_gump.* : 
	  
	  Removing the, IMO horrible, hack to the XMIDI convert types to 
	  support OGG and FMSynth Midi drivers. 
	  
	  Added a separate setting that can be used to select which driver you 
	  want. Config key is "config/audio/midi/driver". Current settings are 
	  "normal", "digital" and "fmsynth" (if compiled in). 
	  
	  Gumps and menus modified to reflect the changes. It is no longer 
	  possible to change midi driver in Exult menu, you must use the Audio 
	  Options Gump.
	  
	  Changing midi driver is now immediate. Restarting Exult is no longer 
	  required if you switch to or from the Ogg or FMSynth drivers. 
	  
	  These changes are just the beginning... after 1.1 has gone final, I 
	  will integrate the New Pentagram midi system into Exult, which will 
	  bring all sorts of wonders with i... ok, maybe not, it's just better. 
	  :-)
	
	* vec.h, files/U7file.*, msvcstuff/msvc_kludges.h : Minor changes so 
	  Exult will compile in MSVC.Net. No projects yet, probably will add 
	  them after 1.1.

2003-11-02    <jeff@mini.nerble.net>

	* combat.cc,actors.cc,npcnear.cc:  No longer automatically put

2003-09-01  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* objs/animate.cc,gamemap.cc:  Check for 'sfx' objs. that aren't

	  around for when trailing slashes are detected in a filename that has
	  been passed to get_system_path().
	* fnames.h, gamedat.cc, gamemap.cc, palette.cc : Removed STATICDAT and

	  caused by trailing slashes on path names! Also fixed compiling

	for all shapes, one shape per row.  (Might still need to add a
	horiz. scrollbar for this.)

2002-02-03  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>
	* audio, conf, files: replaced local versions with those from common module
	* usecode/ucxt/Makefile.am: fixed (head2data.test isn't an app target)

	  Text message for when speech is disabled is yet to be included.
	* audio/Audio.cc : Needed to add unknown voc chunk type '5' for some
	  vocs in SI endgame. Just assuming it is silence for now.

	looks suspiciously like a conf/ file containing all the string 'data'
	for the specifed functions.

2002-01-27  Darke  <darkepaw@users.sourceforge.net>
	* usecode/ucxt/head2data*: Creates data/u7bgintrinsics.data and

2002-01-24  Darke  <darkepaw@users.sourceforge.net>
	* conf/Configuration.cc: istream::rdbuf() under win32 seems to be
	slightly broken. It _should_ work now. Code is a mess, but I want to
	get off this 'doze box. <grin>

	upon loading. The file size would grow exponentially at each write.

	* usecode/ucxt/src/opcodes.cc: Fixed compile problems under mingw.

	* exult.cc: Fixed a compile error with people compiling using
	--enable-usecode-debugger.

	* mapedit/studio.cc (ExultStudio): Open 'chunks' file in both
	binary AND input mode.

2002-01-18  Ryan Nunn  <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* actors.cc, conf/XMLEntity.cc, server/objserial.cc,
	  objs/egg.cc, exult.cc : MSVCisms

	* exult.cc : Xdrag code is not to be compile under Windows.

	* cheat.cc : system() doesn't behave in windows so I call CreateProcess
	  instead.

	* server/servermsg.cc : A little hack for Windows.

	* mapedit/studio.cc : Need to explicitly use ios::binary to open a file
	  as binary. The default is ASCII!

	* shapes/shapevga.cc : info_read was not initialzed

	* mapedit/studio_win32.* , exult_studio_win32.cc : No longer needed

	* mapedit/Makefile.am: removed shapetest_LDADD

2002-01-18  Patrick Burke  <takhisisii@yahoo.com.au>
	* shapes/shapewrite.cc: Added missing using declaration, and fixed
	what looks like a problem with a lack of a cast. It seems to work from
	my couple of tests, but I don't know exactly what the code originaly
	did.

2002-01-16  Patrick Burke  <takhisisii@yahoo.com.au>
	* conf/Configuration.cc: Altered file loading so that loading from an

	* shapes/*:  Ammo is now a field in Shape_info instead of in a

2002-01-14  Patrick Burke  <takhisisii@yahoo.com.au>
	* configure.in: Added --enable-paranoid-warnings, only tested with
	gcc3.0.3, so some of the warnings might not exist in previous versions,
	so might potentially cause problems, and if so, might need some
	version checking code.
	* conf/*, usecode/ucxt/*: Removed all warnings created by the above,
	and added $(WARNINGS) to their respective Makefile.am's.
	* files/rwregress.cc, Makefile.am: Just a quick regression tester,
	currently for the Read*(istream &) series of functions. Found it
	useful when 'fixing' files/utils.h.

	of functions, and removed all the warnings generated by
	--enable-paranoid-warnings.

2002-01-14  Ryan Nunn  <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* audio/Audio.cc : Force waveout as defualt for Windows. Don't use

	* vec.h: explicity typename

2002-01-14  Tristan Tarrant  <nadir@users.sourceforge.net>

2002-01-11  Patrick Burke  <takhisisii@yahoo.com.au>
	* conf/*: Added basic comment support to the configuration files using
	<!-- stuff --> style comments. Currently it's only possible to add them
	between the <config> ... </config> tags, due to the way it defines the
	root node.

2002-01-10  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* mapedit/shapeedit.cc: Starting to show shape info.
	* shapes/shapeinf.{cc,h} (public): 'Editing' flag added.

	lib is independent of code higher up.
	* objs/egg.cc:  Fixed remove_this() for the 'caltrops' bug.

2002-01-09  Patrick Burke  <takhisisii@yahoo.com.au>
	* usecode/ucxt/*: Added ability to specify multiple functions to
	decompile on the command line. Also some namespace fiddling.

	* conf/*: Added the ability to have a 'generic' root node for the
	xmltree, rather then the default 'config', also cleaned up some of the
	external interface to Configuration, and added an additional way of
	accessing the file data through Configuration::getpairs.

	* audio/midi_drivers/forked_player.cc, conf/XMLEntity.cc: Fixed

	* conf/XMLEntity.*: Fixed the destructors.
	* conf/xmain.cc: Added command line option to dump out the exult.cfg
	also when running it. All other output identical.

	'best' was far away.

	* gamewin.cc:  Removed list of path eggs.

2002-01-07  Tristan Tarrant  <nadir@users.sourceforge.net>
	* configure.in, mapedit/Makefile.am: it's libglade not glade

2002-01-07  Dancer Vesperman  <dancer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.in: Move glade detection. Offer advice if exult-studio is enabled and glade is not detected.
	* mapedit/chunklst.cc, mapedit/chunklst.h: Fix broken compilation (standardise)

2002-01-07  Dancer Vesperman  <dancer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* WARNING: usecode/ucxt/src/ucfunc.cc: 830 relied on the return-value of std::string::insert, which DOES NOT HAVE ONE, post-standardisation. Behaviour may have changed.

2002-01-07  Dancer Vesperman  <dancer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/expack.cc broken. Locally provided getline() fails to operate correctly on the last line. Use standard fstream getline() instead. Made sure it handles MAC line-endings.

2002-01-06  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* exult.cc: Init. map for BuildGameMap().
	* game.h,game.cc,exult.cc:  Prepare for newly-developed games.

2002-01-05  Patrick Burke  <takhisisii@yahoo.com.au>
	* usecode/ucxt/*: Added support for the 'debug' opcodes in the Spanish
	version of SI. It'll output the 'function name' rather then just a
	munged version involving the opcode number under -fz, no effect if the
	'dbgfunc' opcode is not found in the function. Also added an
	undocumented parameter --extern-header which will kind of output
	something that looks like a header file for usecode, sometime soon.

2002-01-04  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* actors.h,actorio.cc (public): Properties changed from short to int.
	* usecode/ucinternal.cc (remove_party_items):  If quantity==-359,

	boomerang bug.

2002-01-04  Patrick Burke <takhisisii@yahoo.com.au>

	It will output all the flags used in the usecode file, sorted both by

	* docs/FAQ.html and ReadMe.html updated

2002-01-03  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* gamemap.*, usecode/useval.h,  objs/chunkter.cc: std namespace stuff.
	  Note to Jeff, doing "class ifstream;" and using fstream.h was a
	  really really really bad idea :-)

	* drag.cc, gamewin.cc, gumps/Actor_gump.*, gumps/Face_stats.*,
	  gumps/Gump.h, gumps/Paperdoll_gump.* : Fixing up dropping items on to
	  faces problem, and potential problems.

	* msvcstuff/Exult.dsp : Adding gamemap.*

	including local vars, return var and semicolons in the appropriate
	places.

2001-09-16  Dancer Vesperman  <dancer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Here's a bit of joy: WIN32 isn't SMP safe if we use operator new and delete. On the other hand, nothing else is thread-safe if we use malloc()/free(). So, we wrap the implementations and use malloc()/calloc()/free() for WIN32, and the C++ thread-safe allocator for other platforms.

2001-09-16  Dancer Vesperman  <dancer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Watch and learn. C++ _does_ have semantic eqivalents to malloc() and free(). They are ::operator new() and ::operator delete() (which are not the same as new and delete). This ensures we end up using the same thread-safe allocators. calloc() and malloc() semantics and type-casts are all bound up in two simple inline templates.

2001-09-16  Dancer Vesperman  <dancer@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-09-04  Max Horn  <max@quendi.de>
	* worked on the configure system, re-added various files back to CVS,

	* objs/chunks.cc:  Rewrote part of is_blocked() to handle the way

2001-09-01  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* actors.cc,chunks.cc:  Wrote find_spot(), a smarter finder of
	free areas for things.  Still fiddling with it.
	* actors.cc,paths.cc:  When a companion fails to find a path

	  like it is in MSVC.

2001-08-18  Patrick Burke  <takhisisii@yahoo.com.au>
	* usecode/ucxt/*.[cc|h]: Removed imbedded usecode table; which broke

	asm output format.

2001-08-18  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

2001-08-16  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* objs/egg.cc (Egg_object): Create random # of monsters, and find
	free spots for them (which could be better, since it's not
	checking their whole footprints, but I want to create a general
	method for doing that).
	* usecode/ucinternal.cc: SI crystal balls working again.
	* usecode/intrinsics.cc: run_usecode() replaced by set_path_failure().

2001-08-15  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* actions.cc (If_else_path_actor_action): New action type.
	* ucinternal.cc,intrinsics.cc:  Rewrote 'path_run_usecode()'.
	Still not quite done (got to redo run_usecode()).

	* usecode/ucxt/Docs/opcodes.txt: more updates, changes to handle
	additional output format options
	* usecode/ucxt/*.[cc|h]: fiddled with command line options; added
	additional assembler output options; old-ucs format "works" extremely
	brokenly rather then assert() failing; can now output entire
	USECODE file; squished obscure crash bug.
	* (quick update) usecode/ucxt/*: removed imbedded intrinsic table,
	now stealing it from ??intriniscs.h

2001-08-14  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	  stuffing of Extended Note Events; fixed tempo change; most importantly,
	  fixed usage of REST events (those are *not* accumulated by QTMA hence we have

	  specified a custom screen resolution that we didn't anticipate
	* usecode/useval.h: added missing #include <cassert>

	* gamewin.cc, keyactions.cc, gumps/Face_stats.*: save/restore face
	status

2001-08-10  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* configure.in: also build data files even with --disable-tools (oops)

2001-08-10  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* schedule.cc (Sleep_schedule): Always try to find bed.
	* usecode/intrinsics.cc: Remove_npc() sets schedule to 'wait' so
	NPC won't come back.

	* actors.cc: Got to set flag 0x10 even if in SI, since it gets
	tested in Usecode.
	* actors.cc,intrinsics.cc:  Update_forced_schedule() caused Iolo
	bug in Purity Test; disabled.
	* ucsched.cc,ucscriptop.h: Usecode2 script for fixing Zorkhas
	Bridge crash.

	* audio/midi_drivers/mac_midi.cc: channel pan/volume; tempo; fixed note off
	  recognition; fixed polyphony calculation; dealloc the midi event list properly
	  Now works much better, but I just got a crash for it, so it needs more work
	* audio/xmidi.cc: fixed default channel volume from 64 to 90; initialize
	  all event structs with zeros, which makes debuggin midi drivers easier
	* mac/ExultMac.mcp.xml.sit: new version of the MacOS project file

2001-08-09  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* shapeinf.h: added the 'has_hp' object type
	* objs.*: use the has_hp object type to determine if objects are
	destroyable. (doors are exception). Also call intrinsic 0x626 if
	object is destroyed.
	TODO: do the same for containers. (using the 'resistance' field)
	unfortunately this implies that the remove_item intrinsic will also
	have to extract the contents of a container...

2001-08-09  Max Horn <max@quendi.de>
	* audio/midi_drivers/mac_midi.*: mac midi driver now semi-working! It will assert
	  for the BG menu MIDI (and for others, too), and still lacks some important
	  stuff, but it is a beginning! Figured I better check this in before my HD
	  crashes or so, don't be shocked if you look at this messy code ;)

2001-08-09  Willem Jan Palenstijn <wjpalenstijn@users.sourceforge.net>
	* ucinternal.*, ucmachine.h, intrinsics.cc, exult.*, keyactions.cc:

	* imagewin/scale.cc: copyright of 2xSaI is GPL

2001-08-07  Max Horn <max@quendi.de>
	* bggame.cc: butterfly & "static" are now steered via proper timers, thus should
	  have the same speed regardless of your scaler and the speed of your machine

2001-08-07  Max Horn <max@quendi.de>
	* ibuf16.cc: needed to include cstdlib but didn't

	* exultmenu.cc, bggame.cc, sigame.cc : Namespace, need I say more?

	* various: made it compile on Linux again
	* cheat.cc: heal-party now also restores mana

2001-07-30 Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>

	*.* :

	Can now specify the flex file for ShapeIDs. Added Shape_frame
	*ShapeID::get_shape() to be used as a universal method to get a shape
	for an object. Added Game_window::paint_shape(int x, int y, ShapeID &s)
	Removed some of the Game_window::paint_???_shape() method because
	paint_shape(int x, int y, Shape_frame *shape) or
	paint_shape(int x, int y, ShapeID &shape) can be used instead.

	Added Face Stats for on screen display of stats. Added some shapes for
	the Face Stats. Gump_widget now inherit ShapeID. Made lots of changes
	to the Gumps to  use the new ShapeID::get_shape(). All gumps that use
	custom shapes use the expack generatedheaders.

	Added Gump_manager class to manage gumps and to remove gump management
	code from Game_window. Note, some of the method names have changed for
	Gump_manager compared to Game_window. Added call to
	Gump_mananger::update_gumps() so the Face_stats will be updated when
	required.

	Now saving and loaded 16 bit numbers for NPC shapes and polymorph
	shapes. Allows for use of Shapes above 1023 and polymorph shape will
	now be correct across game restorying. NPC's now have the is_temporary
	flag saved and restored. This will fix up a problem where if a
	temporary NPC was saved, when reloaded it wouldn't get culled by calls
	to emulate_cache_out.

	Can now use the shape brower to specify shapes in the F2 cheat screen.
	Added support for changing polymorphs in the NPC Flags screen.

	Made a few changes so clicking on a gump will report the name of the
	gumps owner. Also made it so if you click on a gump when Uscode
	Intrinsic "click_on_item" is called the owner of the gump is returned.
	This allows for using potions, food, spells, etc and clicking on a gump
	for that person. That included the face stats gumps.

	from ucdump, twice as slow, but it's maintainable.

	* docs/usecode_ff.txt: Added a quick and dirty BNF overview of the

	* actors.*, actors.h, drag.cc, gamewin.cc, objs/flags.h, objs/egg.cc,
	  objs/contain.*:

	  Changed Obj_Flag 18 (0x12) to mean is_temporary. Made Monster NPCs
	  and all items made by eggs have the flag set by default. Items
	  created by Usecode don't have the flag set by default.

	  Modified emulate_cache to remove all objects and NPCs that have
	  the is_temporary flag set and only objects and NPCs that have the
	  flag set.

	  Modified Egg_object::activate so button eggs won't attempt to
	  activate eggs that have already been hatched.

	  Modified Reading and writing of IREGs to allow for a new 10 byte
	  object. The object is the same as 6 byte object, except it has
	  4 bytes added to the end for flags. 1 bit of the first new byte is
	  being used to write the Temporary Item flag.

	  This will cause all new save games to be incompatible with older
	  versions of Exult.

2001-06-24  Christoph Reichenbach  <jameson@linuxgames.com>

	* actors.cc: Workaround for cxx compiler bug: transformed

	(fixes warnings on 64 bit archs, note that this wasn't a real bug).

	* usecode/useval.cc: #include <cstdio> disabled on ALPHA_LINUX_CXX

	* audio/midi_drivers/Timidity_binary.h:
	* audio/midi_drivers/Timidity_binary.cc: Now honors std:: namespace for
	string

	implemented Silver Seed keyring. Data is saved in 'gamedat/keyring.dat'
	* /data/si/defaultkeys.txt: mapped 'k' to use keyring

	* useval.*, ucmachine.cc: moved adding usecode_values to useval,
	possibly risky change: adding (int) 0 to a string does nothing
	* bgintrinsics.h: 0x96 = a_or_an
	* siintrinsics.h: 0xC2 = IsOnKeyring(qual.), 0xC3 = AddToKeyring(qual.)

2001-06-23  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* actors.cc, actors.h: Almost complete rewrite of the add_readied and

	* actorio.cc, actors.h, gamewin.cc, objs/contain.h, objs/objs.h:
	  Changes to ensure that items are placed in the correct slots when
	  restoring a game. This was done by writing a 2 byte index id that is
	  read/written before the item. The id contains the slot number the
	  item goes it. New savegames will be backward compatible, but will
	  produce warning messages on earlier versions.

2001-06-22  Willem Jan Palenstijn <palenstijn@wanadoo.nl>
	* tools/expack.cc: allow NULL entries

	* gumps/AudioOptions_gump.cc: removed SFX conversion option

2001-06-08  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>

	  well as Note On Velocity values. Volume Curve now has a greater

	'killable'.  Also Usecode(eventid==7) is only called when the
	'tournament' flag is set.  Seems to work so far.

2001-06-05  Willem Jan Palenstijn <palenstijn@wanadoo.nl>

	in ExultStudio.

2001-06-03  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* effects.cc (Death_vortex): Death Vortex spell implemented.



2001-05-28  Dancer Vesperman <dancer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* actors.cc: uninline static method called from external translation

	** Double extra bonus points. We now fully compile and link under G++

	* Ucmachine.cc: Just warn on stack underflow.
	* Actions.cc:  Center view if teleporting Avatar, and watch for
	Sequence action being deleted.
	So, except for Avatar being too dumb to open doors, trial seems
	to work.

2001-05-23  Ryan Nunn <colourles@users.sourceforge.net>
	* audio/Audio.cc: Put #ifdef ENABLE_MIDISFX around MIDI SFX code to
	  disable MIDI sfx's. Simply defining ENABLE_MIDISFX will re-enable
	  MIDI SFX.

2001-05-21  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* Rewrote intrinsic si_path_run_usecode() so it now schedules the
	actions.  Fixes double-conversation in Knight's banquet, and

	* In Linux:  Link exult_studio.glade into the Exult data
	directory, and be sure data_path is set in .exult.cfg.  Then,
	hitting ctrl-alt-m (map-editor mode) will run Exult Studio

2001-05-03  Tristan Tarrant  <nadir@users.sourceforge.net>

	* exult.cc: Chnaged from "X-windows Ultima 7 map browser" to
	  "Multiplatform Ultima 7 game engine" :)

2001-04-23  Dancer Vesperman <dancer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* g++ v3.0 can inline an implementation body....but that makes
	  it invisible to other translation units (because it's inline and

		- autoarray.h: Fixed range_error exception definition
		- gamewin.h: qualify ostream with std::
		- pathfinder/path.cc: Fix up inclusion of hash_set
		- vec.h: &*begin() instead of begin. Iterators aren't
			necessarily pointers. vec.h makes lots of foolish
			assumptions that a vector::iterator is typedef'ed
			to a pointer, and that a pointer can be used in
			their place. Not so.
		- files/Flex.cc: std::ostream
		- files/utils.cc: Max will be pleased. We now do things
			the way his compiler does :)
		- gumps/Paperdoll_gump.cc: std::cerr and std::endl
		- conf/xmain.cc: What standard namespace? Fix.
		- shapes/shapeinf.cc: Fix up inclusion of hash_map
		- usecode/compiler/*: std namespace rides again...
		- delobjs.c: std::set

	and shape files. Removed the silly get_extra_shape_file()
	* exult.cc, browser.*, gamewin.*: implement a better shape browser.
	Better help screen
	* data/credits.txt: Text for Exult credits
	* tools/txt2cc: Tool which generates a C++ function which returns
	a vector containing all lines in the source text. Used to compile the
	credits and quotes into Exult.
	* game.cc: implement Exult quotes & credits. Return to menu at the
	end of scrolling.

2000-08-03  Tristan Tarrant  <nadir@users.sourceforge.net>

	* bggame.cc: Failed endgame
	* usecode.cc: Show credits after successful endgame. Quit after
	endgame.

2000-08-03  Tristan Tarrant  <nadir@users.sourceforge.net>

	* bggame.cc, sigame.cc, game.cc: Credits & Quotes

2000-08-03  Tristan Tarrant  <nadir@users.sourceforge.net>

	* game.h, gamewin.cc: if in BG we show ENDSHAPE.FLX, if in SI we show
	PAPERDOL.VGA
	* exult.cc: Default resolution is 320x200 with 2x filter. This is to
	be as close as possible to the original.

2000-08-01  Tristan Tarrant  <nadir@users.sourceforge.net>

	* gamewin.*, exult.cc, usecode.cc: decided to not store the Game
	object inside gamewin, but use the static get_game of the Game
	class instead. "There can be only one" (TM)

2000-08-01  Tristan Tarrant  <nadir@users.sourceforge.net>

	* game.*, bggame.cc, sigame.cc: implemented shape lists. SI now has
	placeholder intro/endgame sequences (it plays the proper FLIcs, but
	nothing else really).
	* gumps.*: use shape lists instead of hardcoded constants. Most
	gumps now work properly under BG and SI. Paperdolling will be
	hard...

2000-07-31  Tristan Tarrant  <nadir@users.sourceforge.net>

	* game.*, bggame.cc, sigame.cc: separated game-dependent stuff into

2000-07-20 Tristan Tarrant  <nadir@users.sourceforge.net>

	* files/databuf.h: implemented an abstract DataSource class and Buffer,
	Stream and File derivatives of it to enable reading data from any of
	these.
	* vgafile.h, vgafile.cc: use new DataSource classes. More classes
	should do this.

2000-07-18  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* Flying carpet rotates correctly.

2000-07-17  Tristan Tarrant  <nadir@users.sourceforge.net>

2000-06-13  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

	* 2 usecode intrinsics implemented:  halt_scheduled() and
	in_usecode().  These are a bit risky...

2000-06-12  Jeff Freedman  <jeff@amy.nerble.net>

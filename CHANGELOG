2/29/00:	Fixed crashes at start and after initial conversation, thanks
		to Richard Wesley.

		Added obstacle detection.  You now need to open doors to get
		through them, and you can climb up/down stairs.

		Replaced XLib and Win32 code with the SDL library.  Should make
		porting to Windows far easier.

2/20/00:	Loads of improvements to the USECODE interpreter, especially
		with conversations.

2/10/00:	V0.10 - Added USECODE interpreter.  
		Removed my previous conversation engine (which I'll use in
		another project).
		Exult creates the "gamedat" directory and files automatically.
		Moved web site to exult.sourceforge.com.

7/5/99:		W.J. Palenstijn's WIN32 port!

6/10/99:	First attempt at obstacle avoidance.

5/28/99:	Wrote a script compiler for NPC's.

5/24/99:	Modified conversation engine to handle the notion of a
		conversation "topic".  Also show character "portraits".

4/23/99:	From Tristan Tarrant:  Read item names from "text.flx" instead
		of trying to enumerate them in the code.

4/14/99:	V0.07 - First implementation of an NPC conversation engine.

12/21/98:	V0.06 - Startup memory requirements are reduced dramatically.
		A port to MSDOS (320x200 VGA) is added.

12/4/98:	V0.05 - Added text rendering using the FreeType package and the
		"avatar.ttf" font.  Left-clicking on many of the game items
		now causes their names to show on the screen.

11/5/98:	V0.04 - 2 other characters walk around randomly.
		Double-click on doors and shutters to open/shut them.
		Program exits gracefully when window is closed.

10/14/98:	V0.03 - Avatar now walks around using the right-mouse button.

10/6/98:	V0.02 - Show moveable objects from "ireg" files.
		Read in all objects shown.  Improves display performance.
		Attempt (with partial success) to show objects in proper
		z-order.

9/25/98:	Try to open files first lower-case, then upper (u7open()).

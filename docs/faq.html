				<p>Jeff wrote on the Boards:<br /><cite>
					I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where
					the 'X' comes from. The "ult", of course, comes from Ultima. It
					was only about 6 months ago [02/29/2000] that I replaced the X code with SDL,
					which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to
					BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder
					to maintain that way.
				</cite></p>
				<p>Ibrahim Holtzmann:<br /><cite>
					I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that
					means "to rejoice, to exhibit great happiness".
				</cite></p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="is_exult_free">1.2. Is <em>Exult</em> free ?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					<em>Exult</em> is more than free: it's Free (notice the caps). <em>Exult</em> is released
					under the GNU GPL (General Public License). This means that the source code
					for <em>Exult</em> is freely available and you can do whatever you want with it.
					However, if you make modifications to any of <em>Exult</em>'s components and publicly
					redistribute your work you are required to make the source freely available
					in turn. Obviously the <em>Exult</em> team would be very grateful if any
					modifications you make are contributed back to the main code, so that
					everyone can benefit from them. If you want to work on <em>Exult</em> just send an
					e-mail to the
					<a href="mailto:exult-general@lists.sourceforge.net">team</a>.<br />
 					More information on the GNU GPL at
 					<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>.
				</p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="origin_exult">1.3. Does Origin support <em>Exult</em>?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					First of all, Origin has been owned by EA for a long time now and from recent
					developments it seems that Origin only exists now to maintain Ultima Online.
					Furthermore, Origin and/or people that worked for Origin claim that the source
					code for Ultima 7 (BG/SI) has been lost for some time.
					So there is no chance for the <em>Exult</em> team to have a look at the actual code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also the team tried to contact some people from Origin earlier but got no positive
					or negative response on the <em>Exult</em> project. So far it seems that both Origin and
					EA have decided to ignore <em>Exult</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand former Origin employees contacted the team and congratulated the
					team on their effort. Most noticeable are Lord British himself and Ken Demarest
					(Programming Manager of Ultima 7)(hint:spell his name backwards).
				</p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="other_ultimas">1.4. Will <em>Exult</em> support other Ultimas?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					<em>Exult</em> supports only Ultima 7 (BG/SI and the add-ons). It will never support
					any other Ultima nor do members of the team plan to develop something similar.
					The reasons for this are that no other Ultima is similar to Ultima 7 in the
					internal workings and also the team used to be quite sick of reverse engineering
					a game already.
				</p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="pentagram">1.5. But isn't <em>Pentagram</em> some kind of <em>Exult</em> for U8?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					<em>Pentagram</em> is a pet project by some members of the <em>Exult</em>team (currently mostly
					Willem, Colourless, Fingolfin and Darke). It is a <strong>map and shapes viewer</strong>
					and nothing more (although the team does indeed invest some time to disassemble the Usecode
					of U8). It isn't meant to be something similar to <em>Exult</em>. It is rather a clever plan
					to stir up interest in other coders to carry this basic work further.<br />
					Any <strong>developer</strong> is welcome to take a look and contact us.
				</p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="multiplayer">1.6. Will there be a multiplayer <em>Exult</em>?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					No.
				</p>
				<p>Jeff on the Forum:<br /><cite>
					The question is 'why?'. I continue working on <em>Exult</em>, in large part, because
					nobody makes games like Ultima7 anymore. While I think a multiplayer game
					would be technically interesting, I don't see the need. There are <b><i><font size="+1">lots</font></i></b>
					of them already, and many experienced people working on new ones.
				</cite></p>
				<p>
					Note however that <em>Exult</em> is open source. If you want a multiplayer U7 no one
					holds you back to code it in.

				<p>
					The latest official version is found on 
					<a href="http://exult.sourceforge.net/">http://exult.sourceforge.net/</a><br />
					Daily snapshots (by Travis Howell) of the Win32 binary and of the CVS source tree

			    <p>
			    	Bugs and not yet implemented features in <em>Exult</em> get fixed almost daily in the code.
			    	A release is very time consuming that's why there are so few.
			    </p>
			    <p>
					The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It is updated almost
					daily, sometimes twice a day. There is information on how to build your
					own binary in the source but there is also the newest pre-compiled Windows executable.
					If you there is no new one this means that either there were no changes to the code
					or the source failed to compile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also this FAQ mainly addresses the snapshots as people use them and ask question.
					And all the new features and improvements are found in those!

				<p>
					<em>Exult</em> should be able to be compiled (with minor modifications) on
					any platform that SDL supports. Right now the source can be compiled
					in Linux/i386, Linux/Alpha, MacOS, OSX, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, BeOS and 
					Win32 (Windows 9x/ME/NT4/2000/XP).
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently we discovered that there is also a working port of <em>Exult</em> for
					MorphOS and AmigaOS. You can find that version at Ruediger Hanke's homepage
					<a href="http://www.muenster.de/~tomjoad/exult.html">http://www.muenster.de/~tomjoad/exult.html</a>. We are currently

				</p>
				<p>
					However there are reported problems with the localized versions of the

					was published in English and Spanish (as we recently discovered to our surprise)
					but we seem to have fixed the main problem with the Spanish version.

				<p>
					Serpent Isle is now playable without cheating and plotholes. Two members of the team

				</p>
				<p>
					Old quotes on this topic from the time when SI wasn't playable at all in <em>Exult</em>.
				</p>
				<p>Colourless:<br /><cite>
					I can't say much about the what will happen except that a completely
					working Serpent Isle will be an annoying task to complete. It is
					close to BG in some ways, but very different in others.
				</cite></p>
				<p>Jeff:<br /><cite>
					My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all
					the work so far on it. I'd much prefer to add enhancements to BG
					(which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG.
					Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals,
					that would change things. And also, since Exult is open-source,
					it would be fine if anyone wants to volunteer to work on SI.

				<p>Jeff:<br /><cite>
					It's not a bug, it's a feature! I like it that way.  Everyone is sensitive to

					This is <strong>not</strong> normal behavior for Exult. Normally when you restart

				</p>
				<p>
					<b><i><font size="+1">Please do not play further</font></i></b> at this point. You should restore to an earlier

				What are the improvements in <em>Exult</em> over the original Ultima 7?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<ul>
				<li>Many more keyboard shortcuts than the original had. Including in BG the
					
	'<font color="maroon">k</font>'
 key that checks if you have the right key for a lock in your
					inventory. The list of keys can be found in the Documentation.</li>
				<li>A new worked over Game menu. This menu is explained in detail in the
					<a href="docs.php">Documentation</a> and many of the following
					improvements  and Video/Audio options can be accessed via this menu. Open
					this Game Menu by pressing 
	'<font color="maroon">Esc</font>'
 in the game.</li>
				<li>SI style paperdoll (inventory screen) in BG. Very impressive. For this you
					need to have Serpent Isle installed on your hard drive and you must set the
					path to it in exult.cfg (see the Documentation) and activate it in the
					Gameplay Options<br />
					This new inventory screen acts sometimes a little buggy, so if an item seems
					to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Game Options.</li>
				<li>A beautiful new savegame box. This allows you much more savegames than
					the original (you should run out of disc space before you run out of savegame
					slots), shows a screenshot of the location you saved at, the members of your
					party, your stats, game time and the date you actually saved. The save game
					box is opened either via the game menu or the 
	'<font color="maroon">s</font>'
 key.</li>
				<li>Face status bars at the bottom of the screen that show your health (and that
					of your party members) as well as your mana. Doubleclicking on the face opens
					the inventory and doubleclicking on the bars shows the status screen.</li>
				<li>Middle mouse button support. In the normal game, the middle mouse button
					activates the target-function (which could also be accomplished by pressing
					't'). for modal gumps, the middle mouse acts as 'return', the right button
					as 'escape', so you can now for example accept the default slider value by
					just pressing the middle button. The escape function is also available
					during most other actions like selecting a target or conversations.</li>
				<li>Wheelmouse support. If you have a wheelmouse some features are auto-enabled
					in <em>Exult</em>.<br />
					In slider gumps (e.g. how much gold you want to
					drop), scrolling the mouse up/down, moves the slider either left or right.
					Holding down 
	'<font color="maroon">Alt</font>'
 while using the wheel scrolls 10 steps.<br />
					The savegame menu scrolls one line, while pressing 
	'<font color="maroon">Alt</font>'
 it scrolls
					pages.<br />
					You can also scroll the map of the game up or down and while pressing
					
	'<font color="maroon">Alt</font>'
  you scroll left or right.</li>
				<li>Fast Mouse which makes the mouse cursor move faster in fullscreen mode.</li>
				<li>Multiracial Avatar in BG. As with the paperdoll support you need to have SI
					installed and the path set in exult.cfg.</li>
				<li>Higher resolutions than the original. You can set the resolution as high as
					your computer supports. But there are some issues with it and it is considered
					cheating.</li>
				<li>Compressed savegames. Since Beta1 <em>Exult</em> compresses savegames by default as
					zip files. They are still labeled *.sav and have the savegame name in the zip
					comment.</li>
				</ul>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="paperdoll_issues">3.12. 
				Are there issues with the SI style pardoll in BG?
			</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					There are some issues. The paperdoll in BG is still limited to the slots
					it had originally.<br />
					That means:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>You can either equip a pair of gauntlets or one/two rings.</li>
					<li>The 'shield behind back', 'weapon behind back' and 'belt' slots are one
					and the same in BG. (So if you have a weapon on your back, you can't use your
					belt slot)</li>
					<li>If an item seems to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Game
					Options, retrieve the item and enable the paperdolls again.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Sparks paperdoll looks very odd (Spark on steroids) as there is no paperdoll
					for kids in SI and we have to use the adult paperdoll. Unless someone draws
					heaps of art we can't do anything.

				<p>
					To get an Ultima 7 that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible there
					are several things to do (though I wonder why you'd want to do that):
				</p>
				<ul>
				<li>make custom keybindings files (see <a href="docs.php">Documentation</a>)
					in which you disable all the keys that were not in the original for Black Gate and
					Serpents Isle.<br />
					Since the Alpha 4 release you have to assign 
	'<font color="maroon">s</font>'
 to old_file_gump
					to enable the old savegame menu (the line in your custom keybindings file should look
					like: S old_file_gump)</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys.</li>
				<li>Disable SI-style paperdolls for BG in exult.cfg (see the documentation for that).</li>
				<li>Alternatively click on the disk icon and disable the paperdolls in the Gameplay
					Options.</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and
					disable scalers.</li>
				<li>The disc icon in the Avatar paperdoll opens the new game menu. As of now this cannot
					be altered. Sorry!</li>

				<li>browse shapes in the main window.</li>
   				<li>drag a shape from the shape browser to <em>Exult</em>, and that
					object will be placed in the game.</li>
   				<li>edit an 'egg' by double-clicking on it.  An edit box
					should appear.</li>
   				<li>create a new 'egg' using the pull-down menu in <em>Exult Studio</em>.
					In the Egg edit box, after you hit 'Apply', you'll be prompted to
					click in <em>Exult</em> where you want the egg to appear.</li>
   				<li>If editing a 'monster' egg, you can set the monster by dragging
					the shape from the browser to the area that displays the monster.</li>
				<li>edit an NPC by double-clicking on it, and also create a new
					NPC using the pull-down menu.  Attributes, flags, and schedules can
					all be viewed and modified.</li>
				<li>can edit other objects' position and quality by double-clicking on them.</li>
				<li>browse the 'u7chunks' file, and drag them into <em>Exult</em> to change
					the terrain.  In this browser, you can also create new terrains and
					modify their order.</li>
				<li>edit a 'terrain' (stored in 'u7chunks') by clicking the "Edit
					terrain" checkbox in <em>Exult Studio</em>.  This is a special mode where
					dragging with the left mouse button 'paints' the currently-selected
					shape (generally one of the flat tiles near the top of the shapes
					browser).  Note that a 'terrain' is generally used in multiple places
					in the map.</li>
				<li>save the map using ExultStudio's "File-Save map" pulldown.
					In order to avoid writing over files inadvertantly, the files that
					would normally go into the 'static' directory, will, instead, go into
					a 'patch' directory that you specify in your 'exult.cfg' file.  Here's
					mine:</li>

					A map-editor needs to provide the ability to display the game, place

					<em>Exult</em>, and it makes sense to reuse it.  So we could have made <em>Exult</em> a part of
					<em>Exult Studio</em>.  However, <em>Exult</em> is already a huge program, and is getting
					unwieldy to work on.
				</p>
				<p>
					With this architecture, <em>Exult Studio</em> can have all the messy code for
					displaying/editing dialog boxes, while <em>Exult</em> only needs a little bit
					of work to handle requests.

			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="terrain_stuff">4.9. What's with this 'terrain-editing' stuff?  Why can't I just
  					drag objects to where I want?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					This confused me too, and I originally planned on doing away with it.
					But do a little arithmetic:  U7's world has 3072x3072 tiles; that's
					over 9 million that need to be set.  My guess is that they came up
					with the idea behind 'u7chunks' to save artists time and to give the
					map a consistent look.
				</p>
				<p>
					The basic idea is that each 'chunk' of flat terrain, 16x16 tiles, is
					stored in 'u7chunks', and is indexed by its position in this file (0,
					1, 2, ....  The 'u7map' file specifies, for each 'chunk' in the U7
					map, which of the terrains is to be used.  Since the entire map has
					192x192 chunks, or a total of 36,864, and since 'u7chunks' has 3072
					entries, each terrain is shared an average of over 10 times.  When you
					go into map-editing mode in Exult, the numbers displayed are the
					indices from 'u7chunks'.
				</p>
				<p>
					So here are the three sorts of scenery that you can see and edit:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The 'terrain' (flat landscape, rocks, shrubs, and first-story
    					buildings) specified in 'u7chunks' and 'u7map'.</li>
    				<li>Other non-moveable objects (second-floor structures, trees) specified in
    					the 'ifixnn' files.</li>
    				<li>Moveable and changeable objects specified in the 'iregnn' files.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					The challenge of writing a map-editor is keeping the above straight,
					and reading/storing from/to the correct files.  It's sorta-kinda
					working now :-)
				</p>
				<p>
					For a more detailed explanation, see Gary Thompson's paper,
					'u7edit.txt' in our 'docs' directory.

				<li>State which Operating System you use (Windows 9X, Linux, ...).</li>
				<li>Please include a savegame (use common sense if it is really needed). You will find
					those in the game directories you put in the exult.cfg. They are called exult**bg.sav
					(** is a number) for BG and exult**si.sav for SI. You can look up the filename int the
					savegame dialog as well (to the right, above the party members). As some parts of the game
					may require you to complete other quests or stuff before you get to the bug you want to
					report it's much easier for the team to look at the problem (speeds the process up a bit
					as they are much more likely you take a look at the problem this way).<br />

					<em>Exult</em> often behaves and works differently than the original Ultima 7. These

					worked.<br />
					Some are bugs that the development team consider to have almost no detrimental
					effect to the enjoyment/running of the game, but would require a large amount
					of time and effort to fix.<br />
					Please don't bother the team about those as some of these will be fixed in the
					future, others will only be fixed when someone who thinks it should be done
					differently sits down and codes it.<br />

				<ul>
					<li>Birds and animals open doors and such, like the human and sentient
						creatures of Britannia do.</li>
					<li>Party members don't walk lockstep with the Avatar like they do in
						BG/SI. Please see <a href="#party_formation">3.4. Why is the party formation different?</a>.</li>
					<li>The way the Avatar and the companions walk. Is it 2 frames or 3 frames?
						This has been changed a lot as this is disputed almost every four weeks.
						Currently <em>Exult</em> is coded using 2 frames.</li>
					<li>Combat works differently. We don't have any hard data or formulae
						that tell us how combat worked in BG/SI, so DrCode put something
						together. If you have any information you've worked out related to
						this, please tell either the forum or the exult-general mailing list.<br />
						Recently Jeff added an option to change the combat difficulty in exult.cfg.
						See the <a href="ReadMe.html#exult_config">ReadMe</a>.</li>
					<li>Negative health and unconsciousness. Yes, it may look weird to have
						people walking around with negative health, but that's the way it
						currently works.</li>
					<li>Some music loops endlessly in <em>Exult</em>. This is actually a correction of a bug
						in the original. We respects the midi looping flag as set by U7's original data
						files but the original didn't. Users who prefer the original (broken) are able

						is triggering a bug in the drivers.</li>
					<li>There is also a problem involving Win9x/ME, C-Media soundcard chipsets and MIDI music.
						We suggest you first upgrade your drivers to the newest ones. Get them at
						<a href="http://www.cmedia.com.tw/">http://www.cmedia.com.tw/</a>. If that doesn't help, please contact
						us.</li>

					Possible <strong>workaround</strong> for the above mentioned audio issues:<br />
					We added a config file option for Windows "config/audio/force_waveout"
					that when set to "yes" will force SDL to use waveout rather than attempting to use
					DirectSound. Using this option may fix problems some people have with sound in
	  				Exult under Windows. Additionally it seems to fix the popping sound when starting
	  				Exult in Win9x/ME/2k.<br />
	  				This setting is now the default setting so downloading the latest snapshot is the
	  				only thing you need to do.

					<li>Max is working to make Exult compile on OSX like it does on all UNIX systems but that
						requires SDL 1.2.3 or newer.</li>
					<li>There is a bug/incompatibility with the flex bundled Linux distributions
						(RH7.0, for example) that breaks compilation. Upgrading to a more recent version
						of flex should fix it.</li>
					<li>Ater compiling yourself remember to copy the exult*.flx files from the data dir in
						the source to the <em>Exult</em> data dir you chose in exult.cfg. This applies only if
						you don't use "make install"</li>

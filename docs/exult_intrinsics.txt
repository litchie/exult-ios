================================================================================
GENERAL DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

For UCC purposes, the avatar is an NPC just like any other. Constants referred
to below (usually in ALL CAPS) are definied in 'src/headers/contants.uc' unless
otherwise stated.

Unlike UCC-defined functions, intrinsics do not have a 'prototype'; you can pass
as many (or as few) parameters to an intrinsic as you like. The only 'hard'
limits are that Exult will not like if you (1) call an intrinsic with more than
12 parameters or (2) the intrinsic expects parameters which you haven't
supplied. The parameter lists in the list below is the minimum safe number of
parameters.

To the right of many intrinsic 'prototypes', you can see an indicator between
square brackets. This indicator is a quick way to see if that intrinsic is
available for the specific game you are interested in. The possible values of
these indicators are:

    Indicator        Meaning
    [BG]             BG-specific intrinsic
    [SI]             SI-specific intrinsic
    [Exult]          Exult-specific intrinsic, available to both BG and SI
    [BG, Exult]      Originally BG-only, Exult allows it in SI too
    [SI, Exult]      Originally SI-only, Exult allows it in BG too
    [Exult: BG]      Exult-specific intrinsic, available only to BG
    [Exult: SI]      Exult-specific intrinsic, available only to SI
    (not present)    Intrinsic available for BG and SI

The '[Exult]', '[BG, Exult]' and '[SI, Exult]' indicators are essentially
equivalent to no indicator at all; they are used in this document only for
completness.

The intrinsic prototypes below are in UCC-esque form. It is actually more like C
than UCC. Specifically, all parameters have a type instead of the UCC-'var'. The
parameter type indicates what Exult will be expecting; the UCC compiler won't
care in the slightest what you pass as a parameter. The parameter types I use
are as follows:

'int' for integers.

'object' is any object or NPC. It can be an object reference, 'item' or a number
(positive or negative, Exult will try to interpret it as an NPC in either case
if in the correct range).

'actor' is any NPC. It is evaluated the same way as 'object' is, but will reject
anything that can't be converted to an NPC. Monsters are also accepted.

'bool' is a 'true'/'false' parameter.

'string' is a string (text).

If the parameter name is followed by a '[]', it indicates an array with elements
of the specified type. Example: 'actor npc[]' means an array of NPCs. If there
is a number between the brackets, it means an array of that length; for
example, 'int num[3]' means an array with 3 'int' elements. In some cases, an
array can be of type 'misc' to indicate that not all of the array's elements
are of the same type.

'function' refers to usecode functions. In UCC, this can be the function name or
its usecode number. For example: 'extern Bolt shape#(0x2D3) ();' can be passed
as 'Bolt' (the function name), '0x2D3' (its function number since
'shape#(shnum) == shnum' if shnum < 0x400) or as '&Bolt' (using the 'address
of' operator '&' to get the function number).

Some intrinsics are 'overloaded'; i.e., they accept more than one parameter
type. In those cases, all of the possibilities are listed as prototypes.

If the parameter list is simply '[special]', see the description for details.

If the intrinsic is preceeded by a parameter type, it means that the intrinsic
returns something of that type; the description explains the return value. In
some cases, the return value can be 'misc[]' to indicate that the intrinsic
returns an array, not all of which are of the same type.

All intrinsics can be called as presented in the list. If an intrinsic has at
least one parameter, it can be called in 'calle' form, with the first parameter
as its 'object'. Example:

    int UI_execute_usecode_array(object obj, int script[]);
    int obj->execute_usecode_array(int script[]);

The first parameter and the '->' can both be omitted if 'obj' is 'item', and if
you omit either of them you *must* omit both or the Usecode will fail to
compile. For stylistic purposes, the 'calle' form should be used only when the
first parameter is an object or NPC (or 'item'). For all intrinsics with
'appropriate' parameter types, I have listed both forms in the list below.

Also, you may have noticed that I did not include_once the parameter type of
'obj' when I gave the 'calle' form of execute_usecode_array; since I will only
give the 'calle' form when the parameter type is 'object' or 'actor', I feel
that it is unneeded.

================================================================================
INTRINSIC FUNCTIONS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RANDOM NUMBERS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

int UI_get_random(int max)

    Returns a random number between '1' and 'max'.

int UI_die_roll(int min, int max)

    Returns a random value between 'min' and 'max'.

int UI_roll_to_win(int att, int def)                                        [BG]

    Rolls a (0-based) 25-sided die. If the result is 0, return value is '0'; if
    the roll is 24, return value is '1'. For all other values of the die roll,
    it adds 'att' and subtracts 'def' from the die roll; if this final value is
    less than 12, return value is '0'. Otherwise, return is '1'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCRIPTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

int UI_execute_usecode_array(object obj, int script[])
int obj->execute_usecode_array(int script[])

    Deprecated; use UCC script blocks instead. Animates 'obj' according to
    'script'. Always returns '1'.

int UI_delayed_execute_usecode_array(object obj, int script[], int delay)
int obj->delayed_execute_usecode_array(int script[], int delay)

    Deprecated; use UCC script blocks instead. Exactly like
    execute_usecode_array, but delayed by 'delay' ticks.

bool UI_in_usecode(object obj)
bool obj->in_usecode()

    Returns 'true' if executing an Usecode script for 'obj', 'false' otherwise.

UI_halt_scheduled(object obj)
obj->halt_scheduled()

    Terminates all running scripts for 'obj', except for 'nohalt' scripts.

UI_begin_casting_mode(actor npc)                                         [Exult]
npc->begin_casting_mode()

    Starts casting mode for 'npc'. When the next script starts for 'npc', that
    NPC will display casting frames (shape 859) until the script ends.

int UI_set_to_attack(actor npc, object obj, int proj)
int npc->set_to_attack(object obj, int proj)

    Prepares 'npc' to attack 'obj' with a *missile* attack using projectile
    shape 'proj'. 'proj' MUST specify a shape that has an 'ammo' tab in Exult
    Studio, or nothing will happen. The attack itself is triggered by a script;
    in an UCC script, use the 'attack' command to actually initiate the attack.
    Return value is always '0'.

int UI_path_run_usecode(int pos[], function fun, object obj, int event)

    If the avatar can walk to to the location specified by 'pos', this intrinsic
    causes him to walk there and returns '1'; otherwise, return value is '0'.
    When the avatar gets to the destination, Exult will can usecode function
    'fun', with 'obj' as 'item' and 'event' as the event ID. If 'obj' is not a
    valid object, the usecode function is ignored. 'pos' can be either a
    2-dimensional or a 3-dimensional position. Note that the player can
    interrupt the path by moving the avatar while it is walking.

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    In SI, path_run_usecode finds a free spot within 3 tiles of the position
    specified by 'pos'; it also allows a rise/drop of 3 in the z direction.
    Finally, path_run_usecode also makes the other party members move.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

UI_si_path_run_usecode(actor npc, int pos[], int event,              [SI, Exult]
        object obj, function fun, bool flag)
npc->si_path_run_usecode(int pos[], int event, object obj, function fun, bool
        flag)

    Similar to path_run_usecode, the main differences are:

        (1)   it is 'npc', not necessarily the avatar, which describes the
              path;
        (2)   the path is uninterruptable by the player;
        (3)   the parameter order;
        (4)   if 'flag' is 'true', 'fun' will be executed even if the
              destination is not reachable;
        (5)   si_path_run_usecode does not return a value.

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    None of the SI-specific properties of path_run_usecode apply to
    si_path_run_usecode.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

UI_set_path_failure(function fun, object obj, int event)

    Used after a path_run_usecode or si_path_run_usecode call, this function
    causes function 'fun' to be called with 'item' equal to 'obj' and event ID
    'event' should the character fail to get to the destination for some
    reason.

UI_telekenesis(function fun)

    Deprecated. Stores 'fun'. The next *script* call to 'fun' (e.g., 'script
    item call fun;') will have an event ID of 'DOUBLECLICK' instead of the
    standard 'SCRIPTED' event ID used for scripts. Since UCC scripts allow
    calling a function with an event ID of your choice (e.g., 'script item call
    fun, DOUBLECLICK;') it is best to simply ignore this intrinsic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIALOG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UI_show_npc_face(actor npc, int face)
npc->show_npc_face(int face)

    Displays frame 'face' of the portrait shape specified by 'npc'. Displays the
    face whose number is the absolute value of the NPC's number. Each NPC can
    only display one portrait at a time. If you are going to show the default
    frame ('face' == 0), use UCC's 'npc.say()' to display the NPC's face and
    display any text within the parenthesis (or set with 'message') too. For
    the avatar, using 'AVATAR.say()' will only result in the male avatar
    (unless using the SI avatars). This intrinsic finds a free slot to display
    the face in or uses the second slot if there are no free slots.

UI_show_npc_face0(actor npc, int face)                               [SI, Exult]
npc->show_npc_face0(int face)

    Like show_npc_face, but always displays the face on slot 0.

UI_show_npc_face1(actor npc, int face)                               [SI, Exult]
npc->show_npc_face1(int face)

    Like show_npc_face, but always displays the face on slot 1.

UI_remove_npc_face(actor npc)
npc->remove_npc_face()

    Deprecated; use UCC's 'npc.hide()' statement instead. Hides npc's portrait.
    See show_npc_face for details.

UI_remove_npc_face0()                                                [SI, Exult]
npc->remove_npc_face0()

    Deprecated; like remove_npc_face, but removes from slot 0 only.

UI_remove_npc_face1()                                                [SI, Exult]
npc->remove_npc_face1()

    Deprecated; like remove_npc_face, but removes from slot 1 only.

UI_set_conversation_slot(int slot)                                   [SI, Exult]
npc->set_conversation_slot()

    Sets the active conversation face to 'slot'. 'slot' must be '0' or '1'.

UI_init_conversation()                                                      [SI]
npc->init_conversation()

    Initializes the face information for a conversation. In Exult, it is usually
    safe to skip it.

UI_end_conversation(int slot)                                               [SI]
npc->end_conversation()

    Shows any pending text and removes all faces from the screen. Usually safe
    to skip this in Exult.

UI_add_answer(string answer)
UI_add_answer(string answer[])

    Deprecated; use UCC's 'add(string answer)' or 'add(string answer[])'
    statements instead. Adds the elements of 'answer' as dialog options.

UI_remove_answer(string answer)
UI_remove_answer(string answer[])

    Deprecated; use UCC's '(remove)' construct instead. Removes all elements of
    'answer' from dialog options.

UI_push_answers()

    Pushes (stores) all answers in a LIFO stack and then clears all options from
    the screen.

UI_pop_answers()

    Pops (restores) all answers stored in the LIFO stack.

UI_clear_answers()

    Clears all answers from the screen.

string UI_select_from_menu()

    Makes player choose one answer among all that are being currently displayed
    and returns the selected choice.

int UI_select_from_menu2()

    Like select_from_menu, but returns the selected answer's index (from 1 to n)
    instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SOUND/MUSIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UI_play_sound_effect(int sfx)

    Plays sound effect 'sfx'

UI_play_sound_effect2(int sfx, object obj)

    Plays sound effect 'sfx' with sound intensity dependent on the distance
    between the avatar and 'obj'.

UI_play_music(int track, object obj)

    Plays the music track number 'track'. If 'obj' is a reference to a valid
    object/NPC, and 'obj' is in the game map, it will also display the sprite
    effect # 24 (musical notes). If 'track' is '255' ('0xFF'), Exult will
    *stop* any music that is playing instead.

int UI_start_speech(int track)

    Starts to play the speech track specified by 'track' and returns '1' if
    successful; returns '0' if can't play the speech for some reason (e.g.,
    speech being disabled).

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    In SI, speech also displays a full-screen face from 'FACES.VGA'.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

int UI_get_speech_track()

    Returns the track number for the currently playing speech track.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SEARCHING/COUNTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

object UI_find_nearest(object obj, int shape, int dist)
object obj->find_nearest(int shape, int dist)

    Returns an object reference to the nearest object with shape 'shape' that is
    within 'dist' tiles from 'obj'.

object UI_find_object(object cont, int shape, int qual, int frame)
object cont->find_object(int shape, int qual, int frame)
object UI_find_object(int cont, int shape, int qual, int frame)
object UI_find_object(int cont[3], int shape, int qual, int frame)

    If 'cont' is a container, NPC or 'PARTY', finds all objects contained by
    'cont'. If 'cont' is a vector[int,3], it is treated as a (x, y, z) position
    and the intrinsic finds all objects within one tile of this position (in the
    current game map). If 'cont' is equal to '-359', if searches the whole
    screen. In any case, this intrinsic returns the first item that has shape
    'shape', quality 'qual' and frame 'frame'. 'qual' and 'frame' can be
    wildcards:

        qual                     frame
        QUALITY_ANY    = -359    FRAME_ANY      = -359

    Note, however, that 'shape' CANNOT be a wildcard.

object[] UI_find_nearby(object loc, int shape, int dist, int mask)
object[] loc->find_nearby(int shape, int dist, int mask)
object[] UI_find_nearby(int loc[3], int shape, int dist, int mask)
object[] UI_find_nearby(int loc[5], int shape, int dist, int mask)
object[] UI_find_nearby(misc loc[4], int shape, int dist, int mask)

    'loc' can be the return of a 'UI_click_on_item' intrinsic call, an object
    reference, a (x, y, z) position vector or a (x, y, z, quality, frame)
    vector; in all cases, find_nearby will look for all objects within 'dist'
    tiles of the specified object which have shape given by 'shape' and are not
    left out by the mask 'mask'. This intrinsic returns an array containing all
    matching objects sorted right to left, near to far. If 'loc' is the
    five-element array, the object must also match the supplied values of
    quality and frame. 'shape' can be '-1' or 'SHAPE_ANY' to match any shapes;
    in either case, 'mask' will be ignored if it is equal to 'MASK_NPC'.
    Moreover, the five-element 'loc' array can use wildcards for 'quality' and
    'frame':

        quality                  frame
        QUALITY_ANY    = -359    FRAME_ANY      = -359

    Here is a list of the mask values for 'mask' defined in
    'src/headers/contants.uc':

        MASK_NONE          = 0x00    MASK_NPC                = 0x04
        MASK_NPC2          = 0x08    MASK_EGG                = 0x10
        MASK_INVISIBLE     = 0x20    MASK_PARTY_INVISIBLE    = 0x40
        MASK_TRANLUCENT    = 0x80    

    Mask values can be combined (by adding them together). 'MASK_NPC' and
    'MASK_NPC2' are treated almost exactly the same way by Exult; the only
    difference being the aforementioned fact that, if 'mask' is equal to
    'MASK_NPC' and 'shape' is not a wildcard, then the mask will be completely
    ignored.

object[] UI_find_nearby_avatar(int shape)

    Returns an array containing all objects with shape 'shape' that are located
    within 192 tiles of the avatar; the return array is sorted right to left,
    near to far. 'shape' can be '-1' or SHAPE_ANY to signify all shapes. You
    cannot find eggs, barges, invisible or transparent objects with this
    intrinsic.

bool UI_npc_nearby(actor npc)
bool npc->npc_nearby()

    Returns 'true' if 'npc' is in the screen and NOT asleep, 'false' otherwise.

bool UI_npc_nearby2(actor npc)                                              [SI]
bool npc->npc_nearby2()

    Returns 'true' if 'npc' is NOT asleep and within 40 tiles of the avatar,
    'false' otherwise.

int UI_count_objects(object obj, int shape, int qual, int frame)
int obj->count_objects(int shape, int qual, int frame)

    Goes through all items contained by 'obj' and counts all of those that have
    shape 'shape', quality 'qual' and frame 'frame'. 'obj' must be a container,
    an NPC or 'PARTY' for the whole party. The other three paramaters can be the
    following wildcards:

        shape                    qual                     frame
        SHAPE_ANY      = -359    QUALITY_ANY    = -359    FRAME_ANY      = -359

    For clarity, use the appropriately named constant for the correct parameter.

object[] UI_get_cont_items(object obj, int shape, int qual, int frame)
object[] obj->get_cont_items(int shape, int qual, int frame)

    Works like 'count_objects' intrinsic; the differences are:

        (1)   'obj' cannot be 'PARTY';
        (2)   It returns a list of all the objects matching the specified
              criteria, instead of a count.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATION/PLACEMENT/REMOVAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

int UI_is_not_blocked(int pos[3], int shape, int frame)

    Returns '1' if there is enough space to place shape 'shape', frame 'frame'
    in the position 'pos'; returns '0' otherwise.

actor[] UI_add_party_items(int count, int shape, int qual, int frame)

    Creates a total of 'count' units of an item with shape 'shape', quality
    'qual' and frame 'frame' and distributes these items between party members.
    Returns a list of NPC objects of all party members that received units of
    the items. 'qual' and 'frame' can be wildcards:

        qual                     frame
        QUALITY_ANY    = -359    FRAME_ANY      = -359

    Note, however, that 'shape' CANNOT be a wildcard. In the original game,
    there is a fifth 'bool' parameter; its meaning is unknown, and Exult will
    ignore this last parameter if you do place it there.

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    If the party cannot hold all added objects, the remaining items are placed
    in the ground. The amount of items that were dropped to the ground is
    appended to the list of NPCs that received the items.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

int UI_remove_party_items(int count, int shape, int qual, int frame)

    Deletes from the party's inventory a total of 'count' units of an item with
    shape 'shape', quality 'qual' and frame 'frame'. Returns '1' if successful,
    '0' otherwise. 'qual' and 'frame' can be wildcards:

        qual                     frame
        QUALITY_ANY    = -359    FRAME_ANY      = -359

    Note, however, that 'shape' CANNOT. In the original game, there is a fifth
    'bool' parameter; its meaning is unknown, and Exult will ignore this last
    parameter if you do place it there.

int UI_summon(int shape)

    Creates a monster with shape 'shape'. The created monster has equipment as
    defined in its equipment record, and has a 'FRIENDLY' alignment. If the
    creation is successful, the return value is a reference to the monster;
    otherwise, the return is '0'. In the originals, there was an additional
    'bool' parameter, but it is unimplemented in Exult.

actor UI_clone(actor npc)                                                   [BG]
actor npc->clone()

    Creates a clone of 'npc'. The clone has alignment set to 'FRIENDLY' and is
    in 'IN_COMBAT' schedule. Return value is a reference to the clone if
    creation succeeds or '0' otherwise.

object UI_create_new_object(int shape)

    Creates a new object using 'shape' as it's shape and returns an object
    reference to the newly created item. The new item is pushed into the 'last
    created' LIFO stack, and is in 'limbo' until it is placed in the game map
    through the 'UI_update_last_created' intrinsic. If 'shape' is a monster
    shape, the object is created without any equipment whatsoever, even if the
    shape has an associated equipment entry.

object UI_create_new_object2(int shape, int pos[])                   [SI, Exult]

    Creates an object with shape 'shape' and updates it exactly as if you had
    called 'UI_update_last_created(pos)'. If 'shape' is a monster shape, the
    monster is created with equipment as defined in its equipment record.
    Returns an object reference to the created object if successful, '0'
    otherwise.

object UI_set_last_created(object obj)
object obj->set_last_created()

    Removes 'obj' from game map and pushes it into the 'last created' stack;
    does nothing if 'obj' is already in the aforementioned stack. Returns an
    object reference to 'obj'.

    ****** BG SPECIFIC ******
    int UI_update_last_created(int pos[])
    **** END BG SPECIFIC ****

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    object UI_update_last_created(int pos[])
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

    Pops the last object pushed in the 'last created' stack and places in the
    position specified by 'pos'. 'pos' can have from one to four elements:

    * if 'pos' has only one element, the object will be deleted (equivalent to
      'remove_item' intrinsic);
    * 2 elements mean a (x, y) location, and the object is placed at z = 0 in
      the current game map;
    * 3 emelents mean a (x, y, z) location, and the object is placed in the
      current game map;
    * 4 elements mean a (x, y, z, map) location and if map == -1, the object
      is placed in the current game map.

    Returns a null reference if the 'last created' stack is empty.

    ****** BG SPECIFIC ******
    If successful, returns 1.
    **** END BG SPECIFIC ****

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    If successful, returns a reference to the object.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

UI_give_last_created(object obj)
obj->give_last_created()

    Pops one item from the 'last created' stack and FORCE-gives it to 'obj',
    which *must* be a container. Returns 'true' if successful, 'false'
    otherwise. The given item is poped only if it is successfully given to
    'obj'.

int[3] UI_get_object_position(object obj)
int[3] obj->get_object_position()

    Returns the (x, y, z) position of 'obj'.

UI_move_object(object obj, int pos[])
obj->move_object(int pos[])

    Moves 'obj' to the location specified by 'pos'. If 'pos' has 3 elements, it
    is a (x, y, z) position vector; if 'pos' has 4 elements, the first 3 are
    the (x, y, z) position and element 4 is the map number. A map number equal
    to '-1' is interpreted to move the NPC to the current game map.

int UI_get_distance(object obj1, object obj2)
int obj1->get_distance(obj2)

    Returns the distance between 'obj1' and 'obj2'.

int UI_find_direction(object param1, object param2)
int param1->find_direction(object param2)
int UI_find_direction(object param1, int param2[3])
int param1->find_direction(int param2[3])
int UI_find_direction(object param1, misc param2[4])
int param1->find_direction(misc param2[4])
int UI_find_direction(int param1[3], object param2)
int UI_find_direction(int param1[3], int param2[3])
int UI_find_direction(int param1[3], misc param2[4])
int UI_find_direction(misc param1[4], object param2)
int UI_find_direction(misc param1[4], int param2[3])
int UI_find_direction(misc param1[4], misc param2[4])

    This intrinsic is aliased under the name 'direction_from'; they are both
    equivalent in Exult. It returns the direction from param1 to param2. In the
    case of the 'misc' parameters, the 4-element array it must be of the form
    {object, int, int, int}; for example, it can be the return of a
    'UI_click_on_item' intrinsic call. If Exult can't make sense of either
    parameter, it will use 'item' instead for that parameter.

    The return is one of the following:

        NORTH    = 0    NORTHEAST    = 1    EAST    = 2    SOUTHEAST    = 3
        SOUTH    = 4    SOUTHWEST    = 5    WEST    = 6    NORTHWEST    = 7

int UI_add_cont_items(object obj, int count, int shape, int          [SI, Exult]
        qual, int frame, int unk)
int obj->add_cont_items(int count, int shape, int qual, int frame, int unk)

    Adds 'count' objects with shape 'shape', quality 'qual' and frame 'frame'
    that are contained by 'obj'. 'unk' is an unknown flag which is ignored by
    Exult; I *think* it is safe to omit it from the parameter list, but I am
    not sure. 'qual' and 'frame' can be wildcards:

        qual                     frame
        QUALITY_ANY    = -359    FRAME_ANY      = -359

    Return value is the number of objects actually added.

int UI_remove_cont_items(object obj, int count, int shape,           [SI, Exult]
        int qual, int frame, int unk)
int obj->remove_cont_items(int count, int shape, int qual, int frame, int unk)

    Removes 'count' objects with shape 'shape', quality 'qual' and frame 'frame'
    that are contained by 'obj'. 'unk' is an unknown flag which is ignored by
    Exult; I *think* it is safe to omit it from the parameter list, but I am
    not sure. 'qual' and 'frame' can be wildcards:

        qual                     frame
        QUALITY_ANY    = -359    FRAME_ANY      = -359

    Return value is the number of objects actually removed.

UI_remove_from_area(int shape, int frame, int ul[2], int             [SI, Exult]
        lr[2])

    'ul' and 'lr' define opposite corners (upper left and lower right,
    respectivelly) of a rectangle in the game map; the intrinsic finds all
    objects of shape 'shape' and frame 'frame' which are inside this rectangle
    and deletes them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

int UI_get_item_shape(object obj)
int obj->get_item_shape()

    Returns the shape of 'obj'.

UI_set_item_shape(object obj, int shape)
obj->set_item_shape(int shape)

    Changes the shape of 'obj' to 'shape'. May need to use
    'UI_update_last_created' intrinsic to display the new shape correctly.

int UI_get_item_frame(object obj)
int obj->get_item_frame()

    Returns the frame of 'obj'. Returns only base frame, without information
    about facing.

UI_set_item_frame(object obj, int frame)
obj->set_item_frame(int frame)

    Changes frame of 'obj' to 'frame'. Preserves an object's 'rotation'.

int UI_get_item_frame_rot(object obj)
int obj->get_item_frame_rot()

    Returns the current frame of 'obj' *with* the rotated bit.

UI_set_item_frame_rot(object obj, int frame)
obj->set_item_frame_rot(int frame)

    Sets the current frame of 'obj' to 'frame'; this *will* change the object's
    facing.

int UI_get_item_quality(object obj)
int obj->get_item_quality()

    Returns the quality of 'obj' if the item has one, or zero otherwise.

UI_set_item_quality(object obj, int qual)
obj->set_item_quality(int qual)

    If the object has a quality, changes quality of 'obj' to 'qual' and returns
    '1'. Returns '0' otherwise.

int UI_get_item_quantity(object obj)
int obj->get_item_quantity()

    Returns quantity of 'obj' if it has one. Strictly speaking, has two
    parameters in the original game; the second parameter is a mistery, and is
    unimplemented in Exult. UCC does not complain about the missing parameter,
    so it is perhaps best to leave it out.

int UI_set_item_quantity(object obj, int quant)
int obj->set_item_quantity(int quant)

    If 'obj' has a quantity, sets it to 'quant' and returns '1'; returns '0'
    otherwise. Setting the quantity to zero will delete the object unless it is
    in 'limbo' (i.e., not in the game map -- likely because it has been created
    by Usecode but not yet placed).

int UI_get_lift(object obj)
int obj->get_lift()

    Returns the lift (z coordinate) of 'obj'.

UI_set_lift(object obj, int lift)
obj->set_lift(int lift)

    Sets the lift (z coordinate) of 'obj' to 'lift'. 'lift' must be >= 0 and <
    20, although it may be rejected if it is greater than 15 (don't know for
    sure).

int UI_get_item_flag(object obj, int flag)
int obj->get_item_flag(int flag)

    Gets the flag 'flag' of 'obj'. Some constants defined for 'flag' are:

        INVISIBLE             = 0     ASLEEP              = 1
        CHARMED               = 2     CURSED              = 3
        DEAD                  = 4     IN_PARTY            = 6
        PARALYZED             = 7     PARALYSED           = 7
        POISONED              = 8     PROTECTION          = 9
        ON_MOVING_BARGE       = 10    OKAY_TO_TAKE        = 11
        MIGHT                 = 12    NO_SPELL_CASTING    = 13
        CANT_DIE              = 14    DANCING             = 15
        DONT_MOVE             = 16    DONT_RENDER         = 16
        SI_ON_MOVING_BARGE    = 17    TEMPORARY           = 18
        SAILOR                = 20    OKAY_TO_LAND        = 21
        BG_DONT_MOVE          = 22    IN_DUNGEON          = 23
        CONFUSED              = 25    IN_MOTION           = 26
        MET                   = 28    SI_TOURNAMENT       = 29
        SI_ZOMBIE             = 30    POLYMORPH           = 32
        TATTOOED              = 33    READ                = 34
        PETRA                 = 35    FREEZE              = 37

    'flag' can be, however, any value in the 0-63 range. The values above are
    for NPCs; most of them are not valid for inanimate objects, and some of
    them ('READ', 'PETRA', 'TATTOOED') have no effect on anyone but the avatar.

    The 'SAILOR' flag has a peculiar behaviour in that it actually returns an
    object reference to the last object to have that flag set or '0' if no
    object has been set (or the flag has been cleared with 'clear_item_flag'
    intrinsic.

UI_set_item_flag(object obj, int flag)
obj->set_item_flag(int flag)

    Sets the flag 'flag' of 'obj'. Many flags have immediate effects when set;
    most do not. See the 'get_item_flag' entry for flag values.

    In the special case of the 'SAILOR' flag, 'obj' is stored to be returned by
    future calls of the 'get_item_flag' intrinsic.

UI_clear_item_flag(object obj, int flag)
obj->clear_item_flag(int flag)

    Clears the flag 'flag' of 'obj'. Many flags have immediate effectswhen
    cleared; most do not. See the 'get_item_flag' entry for flag values.

object UI_get_barge(object obj)
object obj->get_barge()

    Returns the barge object (shape 961) that 'obj' is part of or lying on.

UI_set_barge_dir(object obj, int dir)                                [SI, Exult]
obj->set_barge_dir(int dir)

    If 'obj' is a barge object, sets its direction (along with all objects
    laying on 'obj') to 'dir'. 'dir' can be one of the constants defined for
    'find_direction' intrinsic.

int UI_on_barge()

    Returns '1' if the entire party is inside the same barge as the avatar, '0'
    otherwise. If the avatar is *not* in a barge, returns '0' too.

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    In SI, also forces the party's NPCs to get on board the barge.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

object UI_get_container(object obj)
object obj->get_container()

    Returns a reference to the container of 'obj', or '0' if 'obj' is directly
    in the game map.

UI_remove_item(object obj)
obj->remove_item()

    Deletes 'obj'. If 'obj' is in the 'last created' stack, it is removed from
    it.

int UI_get_usecode_fun(object obj)                                       [Exult]
int obj->get_usecode_fun()

    Gets the usecode function number for 'obj'. This takes into consideration an
    NPC's assigned function (if any) and the correct shape <> function mapping
    for shapes > 1024.

UI_set_usecode_fun(actor npc, function fun)                              [Exult]
npc->set_usecode_fun(function fun)

    Sets the usecode function for 'npc' to 'fun'. This assignment is done by
    function name if possible.

int UI_get_map_num(object obj)                                           [Exult]
int obj->get_map_num()

    Returns the map number that 'obj' is in. Objects not located in the game map
    have map number equal to '-1'.

int UI_get_item_usability(object obj)                                       [SI]
int obj->get_item_usability()

    Returns '1' if the 'obj' is grabbable, '0' otherwise.

bool UI_is_on_keyring(int qual)                                             [SI]

    Returns 'true' if a key with quality 'qual' is on the keyring, 'false'
    otherwise.

UI_add_to_keyring(int qual)                                                 [SI]

    Adds key with quality 'qual' to the keyring.

bool UI_remove_from_keyring(int qual)                                [Exult: SI]

    Removes key with quality 'qual' from the keyring. Returns 'true' if the key
    exists (and therefore was removed), 'false' otherwise.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NPCs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

int UI_get_npc_object(int npc)
int npc->get_npc_object()
int[] UI_get_npc_object(int npc[])

    Returns an array containing the NPC objects corresponding to the NPC numbers
    in 'npc'.

int UI_get_schedule_type(actor npc)
int npc->get_schedule_type()

    Returns the schedule (an int in the range 0-31) of 'npc', as reported in the
    cheat screen. Here is a list of the schedule constants defined in
    'src/headers/constants.uc':

        IN_COMBAT    = 0     PACE_HORIZONTAL    = 1     PACE_VERTICAL    = 2
        TALK         = 3     DANCE              = 4     EAT              = 5
        FARM         = 6     TEND_SHOP          = 7     MINE             = 8

        SPAR         = 27    PREACH             = 28    PATROL           = 29
        DESK_WORK    = 30    FOLLOW_AVATAR      = 31    

UI_set_schedule_type(actor npc, int sched)
npc->set_schedule_type(int sched)

    Sets the schedule of 'npc' to 'sched' (as defined in the cheat screen). A
    list of schedule constants is included below 'get_schedule_type' intrinsic
    description.

UI_modify_schedule(actor npc, int time, int sched, int               [SI, Exult]
        pos[2])
npc->modify_schedule(int time, int sched, int pos[2])

    Sets the time period 'time' schedule of 'npc' to 'sched' at (x, y) location
    'pos'. Allowed values for 'time' are those for the
    UI_part_of_daypart_of_day intrinsic; allowed values for 'sched' are the
    same ones as the return values of 'get_schedule_type' intrinsic.

UI_set_new_schedules(actor npc, int time, int sched, int             [SI, Exult]
        loc[2])
UI_set_new_schedules(actor npc, int time[n], int sched[n], int loc[2n])
npc->set_new_schedules(int time, int sched, int loc[2])
npc->set_new_schedules(int time[n], int sched[n], int loc[2n])

    Sets new schedule(s) for 'npc'. 'time' contains the time periods for the
    schedules; allowed values are like those for the 'UI_part_of_day'
    intrinsic. 'sched' contains the schedule types for the corresponding time
    periods in 'time'; allowed values are the same ones as the return values of
    'get_schedule_type' intrinsic. 'loc' containt the (x, y) positions of the
    schedules; each pair or elements in 'loc' is the (x, y) coordinate of the
    corresponding time period in 'time' and schedule in 'sched'. The 'wildcard'
    'n' is just to indicate that however many elements are in 'time', 'sched'
    must have just as many and 'loc' must have twice as many.

UI_run_schedule(actor npc)                                           [SI, Exult]
npc->run_schedule()

    Reverts the current schedule of 'npc' to its programmed schedule.

UI_revert_schedule(actor npc)                                        [SI, Exult]
npc->revert_schedule()

    Reverts the schedules of 'npc' to those stored in 'STATIC/schedule.dat'. Can
    be risky for NPCs not in the original games.

int UI_get_npc_prop(actor npc, int prop)
int UI_get_npc_prop(actor npc, string prop)
int npc->get_npc_prop(int prop)
int npc->get_npc_prop(string prop)

    Returns the property 'prop' of 'npc'. 'prop' can be an int (in the range of
    0-11) or a string. If it is a string, be sure to set a default value with
    set_npc_prop first! Here is a list of the standard property constants
    defined in 'src/headers/constants.uc':

        STRENGTH     = 0    DEXTERITY    = 1    INTELLIGENCE    = 2
        HEALTH       = 3    COMBAT       = 4    MANA            = 5
        MAX_MANA     = 6    TRAINING     = 7    EXPERIENCE      = 8
        FOODLEVEL    = 9    

UI_set_npc_prop(actor npc, int prop, int delta)
UI_set_npc_prop(actor npc, string prop, int delta)
npc->set_npc_prop(int prop, int delta)
npc->set_npc_prop(string prop, int delta)

    Increases property 'prop' of 'npc' by 'delta'. If 'delta' is negative, the
    property is decreased. Just to be clear: 'delta' is the *change* in
    property 'prop'. 'prop' means the same as for get_npc_prop; if 'prop' is a
    string and the property does not exist yet, it is treated as being zero
    when it is created. A list of property constants is included below
    'get_npc_prop' intrinsic description.

int UI_apply_damage(int unk, int damage, int type, actor npc)

    Reduces the health of 'npc' by 'damage' hits; the damage type is specified
    by 'type', and can be one of the following values:

        normal      = 0    fire         = 1
        magic       = 2    lightning    = 3
        ethereal    = 4    sonic        = 5

    'unk' is an unknown parameter which is ignored by Exult. If the target is
    immune to the specified damage type, no damage will be applied; a creature
    vulnerable to the damage type will take double damage. Always returns '1'

UI_reduce_health(actor npc, int damage, int type)
npc->reduce_health(int damage, int type)

    Reduces the health of 'npc' by 'damage' hits of type given by 'type'. Valid
    values can be seen below the 'UI_apply_damage' intrinsic. Unlike that
    intrinsic, the present intrinsic ignores the immunities and vulnerabilities
    of the target, using only the special hit effects (e.g., bleeding) of the
    damage type.

string UI_get_npc_name(actor npc)
string npc->get_npc_name()
string[] UI_get_npc_name(actor npc[])

    Returns the names of all NPCs in 'npc'.

UI_set_npc_name(actor npc, string name)
npc->set_npc_name(string name)

    Sets the name of 'npc' to 'name'.

UI_is_npc(misc obj)
obj->is_npc()

    Returns 'true' if 'obj' is an NPC, 'false' otherwise.

bool UI_is_dead(actor npc)
bool npc->is_dead()

    Returns 'true' if 'npc' is dead, 'false' otherwise. Equivalent to checking
    if flag 'DEAD' is set.

int UI_get_npc_number(actor npc)
int npc->get_npc_number()

    Returns the NPC number of 'npc'. Intended to receive an NPC object, it will
    works nevertheless even if 'npc' is itself an NPC number.

int UI_get_alignment(actor npc)
int npc->get_alignment()

    Returns the alignment of 'npc'. The following constants are defined in
    'src/headers/constants.uc':

        FRIENDLY        = 0    NEUTRAL    = 1    HOSTILE    = 2
        RANDOM_ALIGN    = 3    

UI_set_alignment(actor npc, int align)
npc->set_alignment(int align)

    Sets the alignment of 'npc' to 'align'. Allowed values are the same as the
    return of 'get_alignment' intrinsic.

UI_remove_npc(actor npc)
npc->remove_npc()

    Removes 'npc' from the game world; 'npc' is effectivelly placed in 'limbo',
    and has its schedule set to 'WAIT'.

UI_kill_npc(actor npc)
npc->kill_npc()

    Kills 'npc'.

int UI_get_attack_mode(actor npc)                                    [SI, Exult]
int npc->get_attack_mode()

    Gets the attack mode of 'npc'. The return value can be one of the values
    defined for 'set_attack_mode' intrinsic.

UI_set_attack_mode(actor npc, int mode)
npc->set_attack_mode(int mode)

    Sets the attack mode of 'npc' to 'mode'. 'mode' can be one of the following:

        NEAREST    = 0    WEAKEST    = 1    STRONGEST    = 2    BERSERK    = 3
        PROTECT    = 4    DEFEND     = 5    FLANK        = 6    FLEE       = 7
        RANDOM     = 8    MANUAL     = 9    

int UI_get_npc_id(actor npc)                                         [SI, Exult]
int npc->get_npc_id()

    Returns the NPC ID of 'npc'.

UI_set_npc_id(actor npc, int id)                                     [SI, Exult]
npc->set_npc_id(int id)

    Sets the NPC ID of 'npc' to 'id'. Only the lower 5 bits of 'id' are saved,
    meaning that the only meaninful values are in the 0-31 range.

actor UI_get_oppressor(actor npc)                                    [SI, Exult]
actor npc->get_oppressor()

    Returns the NPC number (*positive* number) of the oppressor of 'npc'. The
    oppressor can be set through usecode, but it is also set to whomever has
    attacked (caused damage to) 'npc' last. It is also set when an NPC acquires
    a new target -- said NPC will be set as its target's oppressor.

UI_set_oppressor(actor npc, actor opp)                               [SI, Exult]
npc->set_oppressor(opp)

    Sets the oppressor of 'npc' to be 'opp'. 'opp' must be an actual NPC, not an
    egg- or usecode-spawned monster. Also sets the target of 'npc' to be 'opp'.

object UI_get_readied(actor npc, int spot)                           [SI, Exult]
object npc->get_readied(int spot)

    Returns a reference to the item readied in ready spot 'spot' of 'npc'; if
    there is nothing at that spot, returns '0' instead. Valid values for 'spot'
    are:

        LEFT_HAND            = 0     SHIELD_HAND    = 0
        OTHER_HAND           = 0     RIGHT_HAND     = 1

        BACK_SHIELD          = 16    BACK_SPOT      = 17

    Some of these spots will never be occupied in a BG game; they are 'CLOAK',
    'USECODE_CONTAINER', 'EARRINGS', 'BACK_SHIELD' and 'BACK_SPOT'. BG-based
    mods can have items in the 'USECODE_CONTAINER' spot.

bool UI_is_readied(actor npc, int spot, int shape, int frame)
npc->is_readied(int spot, int shape, int frame)

    Returns 'true' if an object with shape 'shape' and frame 'frame' is readied
    in ready spot 'spot' of 'npc'. 'frame' can be the wildcard 'FRAME_ANY'.
    Valid values for 'spot' are:

        IR_RIGHT_HAND      = 1     IR_WEAPON_HAND    = 1
        IR_BOTH_HANDS      = 1     IR_LEFT_HAND      = 2
        IR_SHIELD_HAND     = 2     IR_OFF_HAND       = 2

        IR_BELT            = 11    

    For SI, it is better to use 'get_readied' intrinsic instead.

int UI_get_weapon(actor npc)                                         [SI, Exult]
int npc->get_weapon()

UI_set_opponent(actor npc, object obj)
npc->set_opponent(object obj)

    Makes 'npc' attack 'obj' if 'npc' is in 'IN_COMBAT' schedule. 'HOSTILE'
    enemies will attack party members as soon as their target dies.

UI_sit_down(actor npc, object obj)
npc->sit_down(object obj)

    Makes 'npc' sit on 'obj'. 'obj' must be a chair/seat shape (currently,
    hardcoded to 873/292). For barge seats, also runs the barge usecode when
    everyone in the party is seated.

    otherwise, returns '0'.

actor UI_resurrect(object obj)
actor obj->resurrect()

    If 'obj' is the body of an NPC, resurrects the NPC and returns a reference
    to the NPC; otherwise, returns a null ('0') reference.

npc->set_polymorph(int shape)

    Polymorphs 'npc' into shape 'shape'.

int UI_get_temperature(actor npc)                                           [SI]
int npc->get_temperature()

    NPCs.

UI_add_to_party(actor npc)
npc->add_to_party()

    Adds 'npc' to party if there is a slot available, sets schedule to 'follow
    avatar' and alignment to 'friendly'.

UI_remove_from_party(actor npc)
npc->remove_from_party()

    Removes 'npc' from party and sets alignment to 'neutral'.

object[] UI_get_dead_party()                                                [BG]

    Returns an array with the references to the bodies of dead party members
    within 50 tiles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AVATAR
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

actor UI_get_avatar_ref()

    Returns a object reference to the avatar.

int UI_in_combat()

    Returns '1' if in combat mode, '0' otherwise.

int npc->approach_avatar()

    Makes 'npc' approach avatar at fairly high speed. Returns '0' if 'npc' is
    dead or if it is not possible for 'npc' to reach the avatar. Returns '1'
    otherwise. If 'npc' is initially at more than 10 tiles from the avatar, the
    function will let 'npc' walk for about 1/5 seconds before returning,
    effectivelly halting the game. NOTICE: In the original, this intrinsic
    seems to create 'npc' off-screen, while it approaches the avatar due to
    si_path_run_usecode or the 'TALK' schedule. Need to investigate this
    further.

UI_call_guards()                                                            [BG]

obj->save_pos()

    Saves the current position/map of 'obj'.

UI_teleport_to_saved_pos(object obj)                                 [SI, Exult]
obj->teleport_to_saved_pos()

    If 'obj' is the avatar, it is teleported to the saved position; if 'obj' is
    anything else, does nothing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WEATHER/TIME
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

int UI_get_timer(int timer)

    If 'timer' represents a timer that has been initialized by a previous call
    to 'UI_set_timer' intrinsic, returns the number of hours since the timer
    has been set. Otherwise, the return value is '0'.

UI_set_timer(int timer)

    If the timer 'timer' has not been initialized, this function will initialize
    it; otherwise, it will reset the timer. Subsequent calls to 'UI_set_timer'
    intrinsic returns the number of hours since the timer has been
    initialized/reset.

int UI_game_hour()

    Returns the current game hour (0-23).

int UI_game_minute()

    Returns the current game minute (0-60).

int UI_part_of_day()

    Returns an integer in the 0-7 range corresponding to a 3-hour period since
    midnight. More specifically, the return value is equal to
    'UI_game_hour()%3'. The the following constants are defined in
    'src/headers/constants.uc':

        MIDNIGHT    = 0    EARLY        = 1    DAWN       = 2    MORNING    = 3
        NOON        = 4    AFTERNOON    = 5    EVENING    = 6    NIGHT      = 7

UI_nap_time(object obj)
obj->nap_time()

    If 'obj' is an unoccupied bed, causes the avatar to walk to the bed and lay
    on it, calling usecode function 0x622 once that is done. If the bed is
    occupied, causes one of the party members to pop up and say so. Does
    nothing if 'obj' is not a bed.

UI_advance_time(int amount)

    Advances game time by 'amount'/25 game minutes.

UI_stop_time(int length)                                             [BG, Exult]

    Stops time for ('length'/4 seconds).

int UI_get_weather()

    Returns the current weather state. Return values are:

        CLEAR_WEATHER    = 0    SNOWING    = 1    RAIN        = 2
        SPARKLE          = 3    FOG        = 4    OVERCAST    = 5
        CLOUDY           = 6    

UI_set_weather(int type)

    Sets the current weather to 'type'. Use the return values of
    'UI_get_weather' intrinsic for 'type'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USER INTERFACE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

misc[4] UI_click_on_item()

    Displays the targeting square and waits for the player to click on
    something. The return is a 4 element array whose first element is the
    object reference of the clicked item or zero if the player clicked in the
    world. The last three elements are the (x, y, z) position of the click.

    If used after a 'set_intercept_item' intrinsic call, returns the preassigned
    object as the first element of the array and the object's position as the
    last three.

UI_set_intercept_item(object obj)                                        [Exult]
obj->set_intercept_item()

    Sets 'obj' as the return object of the next 'UI_click_on_item' intrinsic'
    call.

int UI_input_numeric_value(int min, int max, int step, int default)

    Prompts user for numerical input with the bar slider. 'min' is the lowest
    number allowed, 'max' is the greatest, 'step' is the step size and
    'default' is the default (initial) value. Returns the user's choice.

UI_mouse_exists()

    In the original, returned '0' if there was no mouse, '1' otherwise. Exult
    always returns '1'.

UI_flash_mouse(int cursor)

    Causes the mouose to change shape to 'cursor' for about half a second. Valid
    values for 'cursor' are:

        CURSOR_X              = 1    CURSOR_OUT_OF_RANGE    = 2
        CURSOR_OUT_OF_AMMO    = 3    CURSOR_TOO_HEAVY       = 4
        CURSOR_WONT_FIT       = 5    

UI_cause_light(int length)

    Creates a light which lits the screen and lasts for 'length' game minutes.

UI_infravision()                                                     [SI, Exult]

    Turns on 'infravision'.

UI_earthquake(int length)

    Shakes the screen for 'length' ticks. Also plays the earthquake SFX once at
    the start.

UI_armageddon()                                                             [BG]

    The Armageddon spell from BG. Use with care :-)

UI_restart_game()

    Stops the music and restarts the game from the last save.

UI_run_endgame(bool flag)

    Runs the endgame.

    ****** BG SPECIFIC ******
    If 'flag' is 'false', the avatar stepped through the Black Gate; if 'true',
    the avatar destroyed the Black Gate.
    **** END BG SPECIFIC ****

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    'flag' is ignored.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

    If 'flag' is 'true', also sets the game-completion flag.

UI_error_message([special])                                          [SI, Exult]

    Accepts from 1 to 12 parameters of any type, whether or not they are arrays.
    Prints all parameters (and all the elements of said parameters, for those
    that are arrays) to 'stdout.txt'.

string UI_printf(string out[])                                           [Exult]

    Similar to C's printf. Each instance of "%s" in the first element of 'out'
    is replaced by another element of 'out', and the resulting string is output
    to 'stdout.txt'. Return is an empty string.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISPLAY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UI_center_view(object obj)                                           [BG, Exult]
obj->center_view()

    Centers screen around 'obj'.

UI_display_area(int pos[])                                                  [BG]

    Displays area pointed by position vector 'pos'. If 'pos' has 3 elements, it
    is a (x, y, z) vector; with 4 elements, 'pos' is a (x, y, z, map) position
    vector. If map == -1, Exult uses the current map. Overlays sprite shape 10
    over the screen.

UI_set_camera(actor npc)                                             [SI, Exult]
actor->set_camera()

    Makes the camera follow 'npc'.

UI_wizard_eye(int length)                                                   [BG]

    Lets the player move the screen around, keeping the avatar in its present
    location, for a duration equal to (1.5 * 'length') ticks.

UI_fade_palette(int length, int unk, int type)

    If 'type' is '0', fades the screen to black; if 'type' is '1', fades in from
    black. In either case, 'length' is the time (in ticks) it takes to fade the
    screen. The meaning of 'unk' parameter is unknown and it is ignored.

UI_item_say(object obj, string bark)
obj->item_say(string bark)

    Displays the string 'bark' near 'obj'.

UI_clear_item_say(object obj)                                        [SI, Exult]
obj->clear_item_say()

    Deletes the string (if any) being displayed near 'obj'.

UI_display_runes(int gump, string runes)

    Displays gump 'gump' (from 'gumps.vga') and prints one line of runic text
    for each element in 'runes'. As of today (2006/02/23), the exact font shape
    <> gump shape association is hard coded.

UI_book_mode(object obj)
obj->book_mode()

    Used to display books and scrolls; displays a gump shape (currently
    hard-coded) based on the shape of 'obj'. If the shape of 'obj' is equal to
    797, a scroll gump will be displayed; otherwise, a book gump will be
    displayed.

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    In SI, there is one additional shape of 'obj' which displays a scroll gump:
    it is shape 707. Additionally, there are two shapes which will display
    serpentine runes: shape 707 (seprentine scroll) and shape 705 (serpentine
    book). In both cases, If the avatar's 'READ' flag is set, any serpentine
    runes will be translated to normal runes.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

UI_book_mode_ex(bool is_scroll, int font)                                  Exult
UI_book_mode_ex(bool is_scroll, int font, int gump)

    Used to display books and scrolls; displays a book gump if 'show_loc' is
    'false' or a scroll shape if it is 'true'. The font shape in 'FONTS.VGA'
    used to render the text is specified in 'font'. If 'gump' is specified, and
    is >=0, Exult will use it as being the shape from 'GUMPS.VGA' to display; if
    'gump' <= -1, Exult will use the default shapes for scrolls and books
    instead.

    **** IMPORTANT NOTES ****
    Unlike the 'UI_book_mode' intrinsic, this intrinsic performs *no*
    translation of any kind if the avatar's 'READ' flag is set. This is an
    intentional design feature -- for example, text written in Gargish and
    being displayed in a Gargish font should be translated by more than a mere
    font substitution. Also, the gump shapes should be 'compatible' with the
    standard book/scroll shapes as Exult will write the text in the same region
    of the screen as it does for standard books/scrolls.
    ** END IMPORTANT NOTES **

UI_close_gumps()

    Closes all gumps.

UI_close_gump(object obj)
obj->close_gump()

    Closes the gump of 'obj' if it is being displayed.

bool UI_in_gump_mode()

    Returns 'true' if showing gumps, 'false' otherwise.

UI_display_map()                                                            [BG]

    Displays the main game map.

UI_si_display_map(int num)                                                  [SI]

    Displays a map on screen specified by 'num'. Currently, the association
    between map <> 'num' is hard-coded.

UI_display_map_ex(int mapshp, bool show_loc)                               Exult

    Displays the sprite shape 'mapshp' centered in the screen. If 'show_loc' is
    'true', Exult will also display a location mark in the map.

UI_lightning()                                                       [BG, Exult]

    Creates a lightninig effect (flashes screen, lightning sound).

UI_sprite_effect(int sprite, int x, int y, int vel_x, int vel_y, int reps)

    Creates a sprite effect from 'SPRITES.VGA'. 'sprite' is the shape number,
    ('x', 'y') is the starting (x, y) position, ('vel_x', 'vel_y') is the (x,
    y) speed (i.e., change in coordinates at every tick). If 'reps' < 0, the
    sprite effect goes through all frames (at the rate of one frame per tick)
    and deletes itself; otherwise, 'reps' is the total number of ticks the
    animation will last before deleting itself, looping the sprite's frames if
    it is needed.

UI_obj_sprite_effect(object obj, int sprite, int rel_x, int rel_y, int vel_x,
        int vel_y, int reps)
obj->obj_sprite_effect(int sprite, int rel_x, int rel_y, int vel_x, int vel_y,
        int reps)

    Creates a sprite effect from 'SPRITES.VGA'. This sprite effect is tied to
    'obj'; if 'obj' moves, the sprite will move along. 'sprite' is the sprite's
    shape number, ('rel_x', 'rel_y') is the relative (x, y) offset of the sprite
    relative to the position of 'obj', ('vel_x', 'vel_y') is the (x, y) speed
    (i.e., change in coordinates at every tick, and in addition to any motion
    of 'obj'). If 'reps' < 0, the sprite effect goes through all frames (at the
    rate of one frame per tick) and deletes itself; otherwise, 'reps' is the
    total number of ticks the animation will last before deleting itself,
    looping the sprite's frames if it is needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UI_explode(object unk1, object obj, int unk2)

    Causes 'obj' to explode like a powder-keg. The meaning of 'unk1' and 'unk2'
    are unknown, and are hence ignored in Exult.

int UI_add_spell(int index, int unk, object obj)

    If 'obj' is a spellbook, adds the spell whose index is 'index' and returns
    '1' -- unless the spell is already in the spellbook, in which case return
    value is '0'. If 'obj' is not a spellbook, does nothing and returns '0'.
    'unk' is a parameter from the original games whose meaning is unknown,
    hence is unimplemented in Exult.

int UI_get_array_size([special])

    Accepts a single variable as input. If the input variable is an array, the
    return value is the number of elements of the array; otherwise, the return
    is '1'.

UI_mark_virtue_stone(object obj)                                            [BG]
obj->mark_virtue_stone()

    If 'obj' is a virtue stone, marks it with the location of 'obj' (including
    map).

UI_recall_virtue_stone(object obj)                                          [BG]
obj->recall_virtue_stone()

    If 'obj' is a virtue stone, teleports the party to the stored position
    (including map) and forcefully returns the 'obj' to the avatar's inventory
    if it is on the ground.

UI_set_orrery(int pos[3], int state)                                        [BG]

    Sets the position of the orrery in Moonglow. 'pos' is the position of the
    orrery, 'state' is the orrery's current state (ranging from 0-9).

UI_fire_cannon(object obj, int dir, int ball, int unk, int weapon)          [BG]
obj->fire_cannon(int dir, int ball, int unk, int weapon)

    Causes the cannon 'obj' to fire a ball of shape 'ball' in the direction
    'dir'. 'weapon' is the shape number of the weapon information to be used
    for damage information. In the original, there was an additional parameter
    with unknown meaning; hence, Exult ignores it.

int UI_is_water(int pos[3])

    Returns '1' if the position specified by 'pos' is a water tile, '0' if it is
    not.

string UI_a_or_an(string text)

    Returns a string; the string will be "a" or "an" (hence the name of the
    intrinsic) depending on whether the first letter of 'text' is,
    respectively, in the set "aeiouyAEIOUY" or not.

bool UI_is_dest_reachable(actor npc, int pos[])                          [Exult]
bool npc->is_dest_reachable(int pos[])

    Returns 'true' if 'npc' can reach the tile specified by 'pos', 'false'
    otherwise. Returns 'false' if 'pos' has less than two components; if 'pos'
    has exactly 2 components, the z-coordinate is assumed to be '0'.

??/??/01	current

		New in-game menu, with audio options.

		New save gump with mini-screenshot, infinite savegames, etc.

		World wrapping

		More work on ExultStudio (Linux only for now)

		Tons of bugfixes

04/11/01	v0.92 alpha 3

		Savegame names have been changed to exultXXbg.sav for the
		Black Gate, and exultXXsi.sav for the Serpent Isle.
		(The savegames themselves have not changed, so you can rename
		them to make them work again.)

		Multiple scalers can now be used. Use config/video/scale_method
		set to either "2xSaI", "bilinear", "point", "interlaced" and
		"SuperEagle". "2xSaI" is the new scaler, "bilinear" is the old
		one, "point" duplicates the pixels, "interlaced" is the same 
		as "point" except misses every other line, "SuperEagle" is
		another scaler by Derek (the author of 2xSaI).

		New cheat screen (F2) similar to the originals'.
		Currently allows for some level of NPC editing.

		Pick Pocket cheat (Ctrl-Alt-P). Forces all actors to display
		inventory.

		Grab Actor cheat (Ctrl-Alt-G). Default Enabled. When enabled
		clicking on a NPC will make it the default NPC in the cheat
		screen. The default NPC is edited by not entering a npc number.

		NPC Numbers cheat (Ctrl-N). When enabled, clicking an a NPC
		will display their number instead of their name.

		More NPC schedules (sew, lab-work, etc.) implemented.

		Many bugs (especially combat/weapons and audio) fixed.

		Black Gate paperdoll art by Adam Delman and Philip Gottschalk

02/08/01	v0.91 alpha 2

		Dynamic keybindings. Use config/disk/game/(gametitle)/keys
		to specify a keybinding-file. See data/default.key for an
		example.

		Can now use the Serpent Isle paperdolls while playing
		The Black Gate. To use, the Serpent Isle path in the 
		config file must be filled in with an absolute path.
		Paperdolls may be a little buggy.

		Massive code restructuring and cleanup (use STL wherever
		possible, pervasive use of namespaces, more portable C++
		conformance, etc.) These changes have the side effect of
		improving stability.

		Gamma correction (use + and -)

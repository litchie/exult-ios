1. Introduction
1.1. What is Exult?
Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But, being a DOS game with a very nonstandard memory manager, it is difficult to run it on the latest computers. Exult is a project to create an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems, capable of using the data and graphics files that come with the game.
Exult is being developed in C++ under Linux, MacOS and Windows using the SDL library to make porting to other platforms relatively easy. The current version supports much of the game's plot, allowing you to talk to NPCs, use items, solve quests, and even fight monsters. Music, speech, and the full introduction are also implemented. This, and further development, is only possible due to the work done by other fans who have decoded the various Ultima 7 data files, especially Gary Thompson, Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag.
Exult aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993) play the game on modern hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing) its original splendor as is possible. You need to own "Ultima 7: The Black Gate" in order to use Exult, and we encourage you to buy a legal copy.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Configurations
2.1. Installation
* First you need to get Ultima 7. Either you own it already, or you buy it somewhere. Then you must install it on a DOS/Windows machine to get the data files. Alternatively you can use a PC emulator to install it. The Ultima Collection already contains a pre-installed version of U7 (in the directory /ultima7 on the CD).
* From the Ultima7 folder on your PC, copy the STATIC sub folder to an appropriate folder - see 2.3. what those could be.
* Now run exult (exult.exe in Windows) and quit it immediately.
* Edit the configuration file with the correct paths for the game folders and sfx files - see 2.2.
* Run exult and enjoy the game :-)

Word of advice: Don't mix the files from BG and SI.
Important: Do not run Exult on an original Ultima7 game which you're actually in the middle of playing, as Exult's saved files have a different format. There is no way to convert those original savegames and they will just crash Exult.


2.2. Settings in exult.cfg
Exult keeps a configuration file. You can specify where your Ultima 7 installation is, whether you want fullscreen graphics, or windowed, and midi devices and midi settings. Some of these options can be set from the Setup menu when you run Exult or via the Game menu.
If you do not already have a configuration file, Exult will make one for you filling in sensible defaults by itself. The location of this file varies slightly. On UNIX systems you can expect to find it in $HOME/.exult.cfg while other operating systems will probably locate it as 'exult.cfg' in the same directory as the Exult binary. However it is recommended that you edit this file by hand to achieve optimal results for your system.
The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should be simple to understand and modify. Take care though. Handling of syntax errors in this file is not well tested.
Okay, the default file looks like this (do not copy the **and following - these are my remarks).

2.3. Path-Settings
You have two choices on how to setup Exult.
The first one is very easy, just extract all the files from the compiled snapshot archive to the directory where you have The Black Gate or Serpent Isle installed. Concerning the paths you don't have to configure anything.
The other is a little more complicated but appeals to control freaks like me: Make a directory c:\ultima7 make two subfolders named "blackgate" and "serpentisle" (without the quotes of course) Extract or install the two Ultima 7 games into the appropriate folder ("The Black Gate" to c:\ultima7\blackgate and "Serpent Isle" to c:\ultima7\serpentisle) Extract the compiled Exult to c:\ultima7 Now you have to edit the exult.cfg file like this:

<disk>
<data_path>
data
</data_path>
<game>
<blackgate>
<path>
./blackgate
</path>
<title>
blackgate
</title>
</blackgate>
<serpentisle>
<path>
./serpentisle
</path>
</serpentisle>
</game>
</disk>
You can either use the relative (./blackgate) or absolute (c:\ultima\blackgate) path to point to the correct directory.


2.4. Command line options
Exult offers some "hidden" command line options:
* -h or --help Shows all the command line parameters in stderr (stderr.txt on Windows systems)
* -v or --version Shows version information in stderr
* --bg Starts the game with the Black Gate menu
* --si Starts the game with the Serpent Isle menu
* --nocrc Recently we added a crc check that Exult doesn't start when the exult*.flx files in the data dir aren't the same it got compiled with. This parameter lets the game start nethertheless. Don't try this if you don't know what you are doing.
* --buildmap x x = 0 shows all roofs, x = 2 pops them all. You have to specify the game first (Example: exult --bg buildmap 0). Builds the map of the game specified.The map is huge and in pcx format, you will need a lot of ram to even look at this map once it is build (and even that requires a lot of patience)
* --game gamename Unused yet. Loads a game specified in exult.cfg when there are other games made with .




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Audio
3.1. Music
Midi in Exult is played by firstly loading a file and passing it to the XMIDI class for instrument mapping conversion. This is so the MT32 mapped music files from the original Ultima 7 and Serpent Isle will be playable on modern General Midi and General Midi/GS supporting sound cards. You can change the way the music sounds via the setup or ingame menu or the exult.cfg file.
Exult gives users various option for converting Music and Midi Sound Effects. Currently the only way to set the options is via manually editing the config file. Note, the options are case sensitive and all options must be lowercase. Below is a description of all the modes:
* gm This will convert the MT32 patches to standard General Midi patches. Conversion is fairly accurate but some instruments may be different.
* gs This will convert the MT32 patches to their equivalent GS patches. This will be a more accurate conversion that straight gm since more of the MT32 patches are in the GS set. However, not all midi devices will support this mode.
* gs127 This option is for midi devices that have a MT32 patch bank installed in Bank 127. Some GS implementation have this, some don't. Only use this if you know that you have a MT32 implementation on Bank 127.
* none This option will output the music with nothing changed. Because the mapping will be for MT32s you should only use this option if you have a MT32 compatible device or you have replaced the music.

The order of music conversion quality is:
1. none (shouldn't really be used, though)
2. gs127
3. gs
4. gm

NOTE: Currently the conversion to GS and GS127 is not finished and the notes are only mapped to General Midi.


3.2. Abilities and limitations of the music engine
Due to the way the class was constructed input can be in either .mid, .rmi or the Miles Sound System .xmi format. There are no limitations to they types of .mid and .rmi supported. They can be Type 0, 1 and the rarely seen type 2. The loading routine is also fairly lenient of erroneous XMIDI files that do not have correct XMIDI headers.
During the development of the XMIDI class it was found that certain .xmi files in Serpent Isle had the first patch changes after the first note. The converter will attempt to correct these errors. However it may cause problems with some midi files. Currently this can not be disabled and may change in the future.


3.3. Windows MIDI Mapper
You can now tell Exult which MIDI device it should use. Useful if you want Exult to use a different MIDI device than the default Windows device (like an MT-32).
To do this start Exult, on the menu choose "Exit". Now open the file stdout.txt in the folder where exult.exe is located. You will see a listing of the midi devices. For example with an SB Live! in Win2k it will look like this:
4 Midi Devices Detected Listing midi devices: -1: Microsoft MIDI-Mapper 0: A: SB Live! MIDI Synth 1: B: SB Live! MIDI Synth 2: SB Live! MIDI UART
By default Exult uses the Microsoft MIDI-Mapper (which uses the device you choose in the Windows Multimedia Properties). To change the MIDI Device open exult.cfg and change
<win32_device>
-1
</win32_device>
with the device you want to use.


3.4. Digital Wave Sound Effects
Exult needs the so called sfx packs to enable sound effects for Ultima 7. You have to download separate packs for each game as order of the sfx in BG and SI varies a bit and otherwise will sound odd. However there is a little issue with sfx playback in SI: In combat the sfx may be a little wrong as we still haven't figured out all the data in the 'weapons.dat'. Also Exult doesn't yet playback all the sfx that the orignal did.
Note that configuring your soundfonts is not needed for digital wave sfx.
The sfx pack made by Joseph Morris can be found at http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/exult/jmsfx.zip (~4.55 MB) for "The Black Gate" and http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/exult/jmsfxsi.zip (~6.01 MB) for "Serpent Isle". J.Morris recorded the original sfx used in BG and SI which meant a lot of work. Don't complain that the sfx sounds strange, instead load up the original and you will find that it sounds the same. Enjoy!
Extract the zip files into your Exult data directory and write down the name of the pack in your exult.cfg file (see 2.2.). You don't need to set correct paths anymore if the pack is in the data directory. An example of how the relevant part of exult.cfg looks with these packs:
<blackgate>
<waves>
jmsfx.flx
</waves>
</blackgate>
<serpentisle>
<waves>
jmsisfx.flx
</waves>
</serpentisle>


3.5. Speech
Exult can play the Ultima VII's speech through SDL, and its own internal mixer. Configuration is managed through Exult's configuration file.


3.6. Turn off Audio
Press 'Esc' to turn on/off Music, Speech and SoundFX or change the settings in exult.cfg - see 2.2..



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Video
4.1. Resolution
By default Exult runs at 320x200 (which is the resolution the original Ultima VII used). Exult can use different scaling engines to double the size to 640x400 and increase the quality of the graphics.
Using higher resolutions is considered cheating as you can see too much of the surrounding area. Since the game was designed to be played at a specific size, this can actually lead to plot-stopping problems; hence we will not fix any problem caused by your cheating! Don't say we didn't warn you :-) Actually being able to play in higher resolutions is one of the big advantages of Exult but as mentioned above it comes with a price.
Within the game you can use the 'Alt +' and 'Alt -' to switch resolution..


4.2. Scaler
The scalers also work with higher resolutions than 320x200. To change the scaling method either use the Exult menu or change your exult.cfg - see 2.2..
* SuperEagle by Derek Liauw. Only 2x.
* Super2xSai by Derek Liauw. Only 2x.
* 2xSaI by Derek Liauw. Only 2x.
* bilinear bilinear interpolation to smooth the result. Slower, but looks better. Only 2x.
* point simple but very fast scaler. Only duplicates pixels, no fancy interpolation. Can be used for arbitrary integer scales (2x, 3x, 4x...).
* interlaced identical to point except that it skips every other line to be even faster

The scalers by Derek Liauw are slower but look much better. Try out yourself which one you like most.
More information on the excellent scaling engines by Derek Liauw is available at http://elektron.its.tudelft.nl/~dalikifa/.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Movement and Keys
5.1. Movement
* Hold right mouse button down to move Avatar.
* Double-click with the right mouse button will make the Avatar find a path to the selected spot.
* Click on objects with left button to identify them.
* Double-click on characters to hold conversations.
* Double-click on doors, shutters with left button to open or close them.

Note that on MacOS you have to hold down the 'Cmd' key and the mouse button to have the functionality of a right mouse button.


5.2. Keyboard commands
Starting with V0.91 Alpha2 all key commands can be changed. However, there is a default setting which closely follows the original with the addition of some improvements. 

To change your key bindings first edit the file defaultkeys.txt in your Exult directory, change the bindings and save the file (e.g. as my_keys.txt). Now you have to change exult.cfg to use that file. You can even choose if you want to change your key bindings for BG or SI. See the keys settings at 2.2.. Change (default) to my_keys.txt. 

During the game press 'h' to see a help screen with all the keys (for MacOS change Alt for Cmd - the in-game help screen shows the correct key combination for MacOS).

6. Game Menu
6.1. Access to the Game menu
You can access the Game menu either by pressing the disk icon in the Avatar's inventory screen or by pressing 'Esc' . You then have the following options.


6.2. Load/Save Game
This on is pretty straightforward. You can load and save a game, delete a game and view some information of a savegame on the right side (a screenshot and some stats). If you have a wheelmouse you can scroll one line up/down by using the wheel. Pressing 'Alt' while using the wheel scrolls by pages. Pressing Cancel exits the Load/Save options.


6.3. Video Options
In this option screen you are able to determine how Exult displays the game.
* Resolution lets you choose between various resolutions. You can choose between 320x200, 320x240, 400x300, 512x384 and 640x480. If you want higher resolutions edit the exult.cfg file as outlined in 2.2. Settings in exult.cfg.
* Scaling choose between 1x and 2x. What it does is explained in 4.2. Scaler.
* Scaler lets you choose your favorite scaling engine. Also look at 4.2. Scaler for an explanation.
* Full Screen enable or disable running Exult in full screen.
* OK/Cancel Ok accepts your changes, Cancel discards your changes.



6.4. Audio Options
Look at 3. Audio to see explanation on the settings.
* Audio Enable or disable all Audio in Exult.
* Music Enable or disable music.
* Conversion choose between None, GM, GS, GS127.
* Reverb alters the way the midi is played. Enable or disable to hear if you like it.
* Chorus the same as Reverb
* Looping Disable restores the (broken) way the original handeled the music looping flag.
* SFX Enable or disable digital sound effects.
* Speech Options Enable or disable the speech in the games.
* OK/Cancel Ok accepts your changes, Cancel discards your changes.



6.5. Gameplay Options
* Status Bars You can either disable the status bars or choose its position on the bottom of the screen (left, middle, right).
* Text Background shows a tinted background behind text in conversations to make it easier to read. Either disable it or choose between the colours purple, orange, light gray, green, yellow,pale blue, dark green, red, bright white, dark gray and white.
* Paperdolls only available in Black Gate. Enables or disable Paperdolls (inventory screen) in the style of Serpent Isle.
* Walk after teleport only available in Serpent Isle. The normal behavior is that you stop walking after you have been teleported. This enables walking on.
* Fast Mouse makes the mouse cursor move faster in fullscreen modes. Enable or disable it.
* Use middle mouse button In the normal game, the middle mouse button activates the target-function (which could also be accomplished by pressing 't' ). For modal gumps, the middle mouse acts as 'return', the right button as 'escape', so you can now for example accept the default slider value by just pressing the middle button. The escape function is also available during most other actions like selecting a target or conversations. Enable or disable it.
* Doubleclick closes gumps pretty straightforward, right?
* Cheats Enables or disables all the cheats that we implemented in Exult. See 5.3. Cheat keys what those cheats are.
* Speed if Exult seems too fast lower this setting. If it seems to sluggish raising this setting may help.
* OK/Cancel Ok accepts your changes, Cancel discards your changes.



6.6. Quit to Menu
This is not implemented yet and just quits Exult. When it eventually works you will be back to the Exult menu where you choose which game you want to play. It is actually more difficult to implement than it sounds so don't expect it too soon.
In snapshots after the Beta 1 release this option is no longer availlable.


6.7. Quit
Exits Exult.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. OS specific notes
7.1. Error Log
* MacOS/Win32: Exult generates the files 'stdout.txt' and 'stderr.txt'. These may give you some idea of what is going on under the hood. When Exult suddenly quits, sometimes these files can help.
* UNIX/UNIX clones: the above mentioned logs are shown in the console from which Exult is started. ./exult >&log will send both stderr and stdout to the file named "log".




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Credits and Contact
8.1. Thanks
* The paper by Gary Thompson on the structure of the U7 data files was crucial to the early development of Exult.
* Work by Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag made the "usecode" interpreter possible.
* Olivier Marcoux's technical document was also crucial in understanding some data files.
* Thanks also go to the person who wrote u7items.txt and the contributor of the "avatar.ttf" font.

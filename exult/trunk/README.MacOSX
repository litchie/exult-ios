Exult instructions for Mac OS X
-------------------------------


To play
-------
First you need to get Ultima 7. Either you own it already, or
you buy it somewhere. Then you must install it on a DOS/Windows
machine in order to get the data file. A good way is to use a
PC emulator for this, e.g. Virtual PC, Real PC or SoftWindows.
Note that the Ultima Collection already contains an installed
copy of Ultima 7. (In the Ultima7/ directory.)

From the Ultima7 folder on your PC, copy the STATIC sub folder
to the folder that contains the ExultMac application.

Now run ExultMac, and have fun!

How to compile on Mac OS X
--------------------------

Make sure you have the Apple developer tools installed. They ship with
Mac OS X, but have to be installed separately. You can also download the
latest version for free from http://connect.apple.com

In order to compiler Exult, you need to install several Unix packages.
If you are an expert, you may want to install them manually; for all others,
we recommend installing them via Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net). In
particular, you need these packages:
Install these packages with Fink:
  sdl
  sdl-mixer

If you are compiling the source code CVS, as opposed to the source of
a released version, you also need to install these packages:
  automake1.9
  libtool14
(for the experts: old versions of the automake package should also work,
e.g. you could also use automake1.8 or automake1.7).

Now you are ready to compiler Exult. If you are compiling from CVS, the
first thing you have to run is this:
  ./autogen.sh

The next step is the same whether you compile a release version or CVS:
  ./configure
  make

This will give you a "exult" binary in the current directory. If you want
a nice Exult.app (double clickable from the Finder and all), enter this
command:
  make bundle

Be warned, the binary created this way is not static linked, that means if
you copy it to another machine it will most likely not work. So you can only
use it on your own computer.


If you want to compile Exult Studio, you have to install this package:
  libglade2

This might actually cause many other packages required by libglade2 to
be installed.
After that, you have to re-run configure and make:
  ./configure --enable-exult-studio
  make

Exult instructions for Windows
------------------------------------


To play
---------
Copy exult.exe into your Ultima 7 directory.
If you are currently playing a game of Ultima 7, be sure 
 to remove the gamedat directory. (don't forget to back
 it up first...)
Run exult.exe
Have fun!


Notes
------
* Exult generates the files 'stdout.txt' and 'stderr.txt'.
These may give you some idea of what is going on
under the hood. When Exult suddenly quits, sometimes
these files can help.

* If you're interested in building Exult for windows yourself, 
there are two sections below describing how.


To build in Windows using MinGW
-----------------------------------
(Thanks to Travis Howell)

Download MinGW 1.0 or later from:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-1.1.tar.gz

Extract the files to a mingw directory in root directory of drive
(ie C:\mingw\ )

Get the zlib binaries & headers from:
http://exult.sourceforge.net/snapshots/exult_zlib_win32.zip
Unzip this file into the MinGW directory. 

Get the SDL binaries & headers from:
http://exult.sourceforge.net/snapshots/exult_sdl_win32.zip
Unzip this file into the Exult directory. (it should add a SDL subdirectory)

If you want to compile the Exult Tools get the bison, flex and libpng binaries & headers from:
http://exult.sourceforge.net/snapshots/exult_bison_win32.zip
http://exult.sourceforge.net/snapshots/exult_flex_win32.zip
http://exult.sourceforge.net/snapshots/exult_libpng_win32.zip
Unzip these files into the MinGW directory.

If you want to compile Exult Studio get the libglade, libpng and freetype binaries & headers from:
http://exult.sourceforge.net/snapshots/exult_libglade_win32.zip
http://exult.sourceforge.net/snapshots/exult_libpng_win32.zip
Then get the pkconfig, glib, gtk+, libiconv and libintl binaries & headers from http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html :
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/pkgconfig-0.11-20020310.zip
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/glib-2.0.3-20020525.zip
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/glib-dev-2.0.3-20020525.zip
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/gtk+-1.3.0-20020313.zip
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/gtk+-dev-1.3.0-20020313.zip
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/libiconv-1.7.zip
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/libiconv-dev-1.7.zip
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/libintl-0.10.40-20020310.zip
http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/freetype-dev-2.0.5-20020112.zip
Unzip these files into the MinGW directory.
Download the MinGW work around required for compiling Exlt Studio from:
http://exult.sourceforge.net/snapshots/exult_hack_win32.zip
Unzip this file into the main directory of exult source code

Open Command Prompt or MS-DOS Prompt

Type 'PATH=drive:\mingw\bin;drive:\mingw\lib;%PATH%' where drive is the letter of the hard disk you installed MinGW on to, without quotes to add MinGW to the path
(ie PATH=C:\mingw\bin;C:\mingw\lib;%PATH% )

Change to the directory where you unpacked the Exult source code.
(cd C:\exult\)

Open makefile.win32 from the Exult directory in a text editor and change C:\\Ultima7 to the directory you want Exult to be installed to.
(ie C:\\Games\\Ultima7 )

If you are compiling Exult Studio, open makefile.studio.mingw from the Exult directory in a text editor and change C:\\Ultima7 to the directory you want Exult Studio to be installed to. 
(It must be the same directory that Exult is installed into to!)
(ie C:\\Games\\Ultima7 )

Type 'make -f makefile.win32 install' without quotes to compile and install Exult for Windows

Type 'make -f makefile.win32 toolsinstall' without quotes to compile and install the Exult Tools for Windows

Type 'make_studio' without quotes to compile and install Exult Studio for Windows
Then copy over the required library files (*.dll) from the lib directory of MinGW to the installation directory of Exult Studio

Once compile has finished and been installed exit the Command Prompt or MS-DOS Prompt

Run Exult.exe and enjoy the game :-)


To build in Windows using MSVC 6.0
----------------------------------

1) Download SDL and ZLib for Win32/MSVC6. Add their Include and Library
directories to MSVC's Search Directories (Tools->Options->Directories).

SDL: http://www.libsdl.org/
ZLib: http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

2) Set The environment variable EXULT_INSTALL_PATH to the directory where you
want the Exult binaries to be copied to when doing an Install Build. This is
optional and is only required for when doing an Install build.

3) Load the Exult Project Workspace "msvcstuff/Exult.dsw" in MSVC 6.0
(File->Load Workspace)

4) If required, enter the correct "Working Directory" in the "Debug tab" of the
Exult project settings for all Configurations.

5) Select and Build Exult using one of the 4 Configuration (Win32 Debug,
Win32 Release, Win32 Debug Install or Win32 Release Install).

6) Have Fun!


To cross-build from Linux
---------------------------
(Note: this hasn't been tested recently, and may or may not work)

Exult is originally a Linux project, using a platform
independent API called SDL. (Simple DirectMedia Layer)

Because of this, the Windows version has been built in
Linux, using the cross-compiler Mingw32.

Please note it is not necessary to build Exult yourself,
since the Windows executable is already included.

1) get and install Mingw32 and SDL.

SDL: http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/

Mingw32: http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/Xmingw32/

Installation instructions can be found on the same pages.
(make sure to get the DirectX headers, and build SDL for the cross compiler)

2) build exult:

configure --host=i386-linux --target=i386-mingw32 --enable-win32
make

3) copy exult.exe to your U7 directory, and run it from windows
If you are currently playing a game of Ultima 7, be sure
to make a backup of the gamedat directory.
 
4) Have fun :-)

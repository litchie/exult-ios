Exult instructions for Windows
------------------------------------


To play
---------
Copy exult.exe into your Ultima 7 directory.
If you are currently playing a game of Ultima 7, be sure 
 to remove the gamedat directory. (don't forget to back
 it up first...)
Run exult.exe
Have fun!


Notes
------
* Exult generates the files 'stdout.txt' and 'stderr.txt'.
These may give you some idea of what is going on
under the hood. When Exult suddenly quits, sometimes
these files can help.

* If you're interested in building Exult for windows yourself, 
there are two sections below describing how.


To build in Windows using MinGW
-----------------------------------
(Thanks to Travis Howell)

Download MinGW 1.0 or later from (for example):    (one line)
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/Mingw-1.0.1-20010726.tar.gz

Extract the files to a mingw directory in root directory of drive
(ie C:\mingw\ )

Get the SDL binaries & headers from:
http://exult.on.openave.net/SDL-1.2.2.zip
Unzip this file into the Exult directory. (it should add a SDL subdirectory)

Open Command Prompt or MS-DOS Prompt

Type 'PATH=drive:\mingw\bin;%PATH%' where drive is the letter of the hard disk you installed mingw on to, without quotes to add mingw to the path
(ie PATH=C:\mingw\bin;%PATH% )

Change to the directory where you unpacked the Exult source code.
(cd C:\exult\)

Open makefile.win32 from the Exult directory in a text editor and change C:\\Ultima7 to the directory you want Exult to be installed to.
(ie C:\\Games\\Ultima7 )

Type 'make -f makefile.win32 install' without quotes to compile and install Exult for Windows

Once compile has finished and been installed exit the Command Prompt or MS-DOS Prompt

Run Exult.exe and enjoy the game :-)


To cross-build from Linux
---------------------------
(Note: this hasn't been tested recently, and may or may not work)

Exult is originally a Linux project, using a platform
independent API called SDL. (Simple DirectMedia Layer)

Because of this, the Windows version has been built in
Linux, using the cross-compiler Mingw32.

Please note it is not necessary to build Exult yourself,
since the Windows executable is already included.

1) get and install Mingw32 and SDL.

SDL: http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/

Mingw32: http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/Xmingw32/

Installation instructions can be found on the same pages.
(make sure to get the DirectX headers, and build SDL for the cross compiler)

2) build exult:

configure --host=i386-linux --target=i386-mingw32 --enable-win32
make

3) copy exult.exe to your U7 directory, and run it from windows
If you are currently playing a game of Ultima 7, be sure
to make a backup of the gamedat directory.
 
4) Have fun :-)

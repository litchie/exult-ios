--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction
1.1. Why is it called Exult - what is the meaning of this name?
Jeff wrote on the Boards:
I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where the 'X' comes from. The "ult", of course, comes from Ultima. It was only about 6 months ago [02/29/2000] that I replaced the X code with SDL, which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder to maintain that way.

Ibrahim Holtzmann:
I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that means "to rejoice, to exhibit great happiness".


1.2. Is Exult free ?
Exult is more than free: it's Free (notice the caps). Exult is released under the GNU GPL (General Public License). This means that the source code for Exult is freely available and you can do whatever you want with it. However, if you make modifications to any of Exult's components and publicly redistribute your work you are required to make the source freely available in turn. Obviously the Exult team would be very grateful if any modifications you make are contributed back to the main code, so that everyone can benefit from them. If you want to work on Exult just send an e-mail to the team. More information on the GNU GPL at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.


1.3. Does Origin support Exult?
First of all, Origin has been owned by EA for a long time now and from recent developements it seems that Origin only exists now to maintain Ultima Online. Furthermore, Origin and/or people that worked for Origin claim that the source code for Ultima 7 (BG/SI) has been lost for some time. So there is no chance for the Exult team to have a look at the actual code.
Also the team tried to contact some people from Origin earlier but got no positive or negative response on the Exult project. So far it seems that both Origin and EA have decided to ignore Exult.
On the other hand former Origin employees contacted the team and congratulated the team on their effort. Most noticeable are Lord British himself and Ken Demarest (Programming Manager of Ultima 7)(hint:spell his name backwards).


1.4. Will Exult support other Ultimas?
Exult supports only Ultima 7 (BG/SI and the add-ons). It will never support any other Ultima nor do members of the team plan to develop something similar. The reasons for this are that no other Ultima is similar to Ultima 7 in the internal workings and also the team is quite sick of reverse engineering a game allready.


1.5. Will there be a multiplayer Exult?
No.

Jeff on the Forum:
The question is 'why?'. I continue working on Exult, in large part, because nobody makes games like Ultima7 anymore. While I think a multi-player game would be technically interesting, I don't see the need. There are lots of them already, and many experienced people working on new ones.
Note however that Exult is open source. If you want a multiplayer U7 no one holds you back to code it in.


1.6. Where do I find Exult?
The latest official version is found on http://exult.sourceforge.net/ Daily snapshots of the Win32 binary and of the CVS source tree can be found at http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php


1.7. What is a snapshot? Are these screenshots or what?
Bugs and not yet implemented features in Exult get fixed almost daily in the code. A release is very time consuming that's why there are so few.
The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It is updated almost daily, sometimes twice a day. There is information on how to build your own binary in the source but there is also the newest pre-compiled Windows binary. If you there is no new one this means that either there were no changes to the code or the source failed to compile.
Also this FAQ mainly addresses the snapshots as people use them and ask question.


1.8. How do I compile a source code snapshot for my OS?
The source code snapshots contain a file called "README.OS" (like Readme.win32, Readme.MacOS) that explains everything.


1.9. What is the latest version of Exult?
The current official release is V0.93 Alpha4. See also 1.6. to learn where to get the latest version.
To find out which version you are running, press 'v' while in game.


1.10. On what platform does Exult run?
Exult should be able to be compiled (with minor modifications) on any platform that SDL supports. Right now the source can be compiled in Linux/i386, Linux/Alpha, MacOS, OSX, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, BeOS and Win32 (Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000).



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Exult and Ultima 7
2.1. Do I need Ultima 7?
Yes. Exult won't work without the original files.


2.2. Does Exult work on all versions of the game?
It seems to run most of the available versions of the game. The most common ones nowadays with the included Add-Ons (Forge of Virtue and Silver Seed) runs for sure.
However there are reported problems with the localized versions of the game (French, German and Spanish). Conversation threads don't seem to skip to the next line in the proper places and therefore are unreadable in some cases. SI was only published in English so no localization problems with that one.
V0.91 Alpha2 adds fixes for the french version, which should work now. No work has been done for the german version, due to lack of testers. If you have the German or Spanish version, and want it to run, contact us.


2.3. How about Serpent Isle?
The team is working on it. It is not yet fully playable but you can walk around, talk to people, finish a lot of quests... Plotwise you will get quite far but you certainly won't be able to play through it yet.
Old quotes on this topic from the time when SI wasn't playable at all in Exult.

Colourless:
I can't say much about the what will happen except that a completely working Serpent Isle will be an annoying task to complete. It is close to BG in some ways, but very different in others.

Jeff:
My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all the work so far on it. I'd much prefer to add enhancements to BG (which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG. Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals, that would change things. And also, since Exult is open-source, it would be fine if anyone wants to volunteer to work on SI.


2.4. Do the Add-Ons work?
"Forge of Virtue" (Add-On to Black Gate) and the "The Silver Seed" (Add-On to Serpent Isle) are bug-free now.


2.5. Can you play through U7 yet?
You can play through the Black Gate/Forge of Virtue without cheating and plotholes. SI is partially playable since V0.91 Alpha2.


2.6. Do savegames from the original work in Exult?
Savegames that were made with the original Ultima 7 or U7Run don't work with Exult. You have to start a new game when you begin playing with Exult. Sorry!


2.7. Where do I find Ultima 7 on the net to download?
Don't! You may be able to find it on the net but it would be pirating the game and the Exult team doesn't support pirates. Look for the Ultima Collection in stores or on Ebay (http://www.ebay.com).
Don't ask the team for copies.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Miscellaneous
3.1. Do the various cheat rooms work?
Yes.


3.2. Where Do I find them
Just keep on looking for them :-)


3.3. Do the carriages, ships and the magic carpet work?
Yes. The sail of ships look odd sometimes but otherwise these means of transportations work quite well.


3.4. Why is the party formation different?
In Exult the party (the Avatar and his companions) move quite differently than they do in the original. This is actually not a bug but a disliking of the old style.

Jeff:
It's not a bug, it's a feature! I like it that way. Everyone is sensitive to different things, and I always though the formation-walking in the original U7 looked really stupid. Eventually, someone may add the original type of walking to Exult, probably as an option.


3.5. Serpent Isle had many more improvements over Black Gate (keyring, better paperdoll...). Will these be implemented?
Right now the main goal is to get the Black Gate 100% working. After that it could be that some more things will be improved as far as it is possible to implement these.
The keyring is not in Black Gate but there is the 'k' key which tries all the keys in the inventory to open a lock.
Recently Ryan added paperdoll support in Black Gate. Though it is still buggy (some items disappear to Neverneverland) it is beautiful to look at. Very impressive. For this you need to have Serpent Isle installed on your hard drive and you must set the path to it in exult.cfg (see the Documentation). If an item seems to have disappeared press 'F2' to activate the cheat menu and disable Paperdolls. Now you should find that missing item in your inventory.


3.6. Any other improvements/features?
Since the Alpha 4 release a new game menu was added with improved Audio and Video Options boxes (the Gameplay Options don't work yet) and a very much improved (awesome)savegame box. This allows you much more savegames than the original (you should run out of disc space before you run out of savegame slots), shows a screenshot of the location you saved at, the members of your party, your stats, game time and the date you actually saved. The game menu is opened via 'Esc' and the save game box is opened either via the game menu or the 's' key.
Post Alpha 4 the team added status bars to the game. Press 'r' while playing to see it.
In Exult, you can still move your party even if there is a box/body/stats open/on. In the original, the world was kind of frozen. Now it is only frozen if you hit the 't' or 's' key.


3.7. How do I disable all improvements?
To get an Ultima 7 that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible there are several things to do (though I wonder why you'd want to do that):
* make custom keybindings files (see Documentation) in which you disable all the keys that were not in the original for Black Gate and Serpents Isle. Since the Alpha 4 release you have to assign 's' to old_file_gump to enable the old savegame menu (the line in your custom keybindings file should look like: S old_file_gump)
* Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys.
* Don't set the path to the Serpent Isle files (see Documentation) and put SI and a second copy of Exult in a seperate directory (note: you can no longer launch both BG and SI from the same exult.exe). This disables SI paperdolls in BG.
* Alternatively you can leave the cheat menu binding in the keybindings file ( 'F2' ) and disable "Paperdolls" each time you run Exult.
* Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and disable scalers.
* The disc icon in the Avatar paperdoll opens the new game menu. As of now this cannot be altered. Sorry!



3.8. I heard that Exult is meant to be a game engine. Can I make my own game with Exult?
Work has begun on "" which is aimed to be an editor for all kinds of files that are used by Ultima 7. As of now there is already a Gimp plug-in to edit shapes.
For much more information "" see 4. Exult Studio.

Jeff:
As for the future, my main plan is to add editing capabilities, with the long-range goal of writing an original RPG.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Exult Studio
4.1. What is it?
is a map-editor for Exult, allowing you to modify the map of a game and, eventually, to create a completely new landscape for a new game.


4.2. Who came up with the cool name?
Tristan


4.3. What do you need to run it?
Currently, you need to be running Exult on X (Linux, Unix, etc.), with Exult set to run in a window (not fullscreen). You also need the GTK+ library installed.


4.4. When will it be ported to other platforms?
That depends on when someone volunteers to do the work :-) There are three issues:
* GTK has to be ported to the platform. I think this is already true for Win32.
* uses sockets to communicate with Exult. This also shouldn't be a problem for Win32.
* X drag-n-drop is used to put new objects on the landscape. The 'drop' part of this will have to be rewritten for Win32 Exult, OR, drag-n-drop could be an enhancement to SDL someday.



4.5. How do you run it?
You can run all by itself, but it isn't useful that way, as it uses Exult as a server. What you really want to do is:
* Put 'exult_studio.glade' in the Exult 'data' directory.
* Be sure 'exult_studio' is in your path.
* Run Exult.
* Press 'alt-ctrl-m' to go into 'map-editor' mode. If all is set up correctly, exult_studio will start up, and will have a list of files on the left side of its window.

You can also start up one or the other separately, and they'll reconnect:
* If Exult isn't running, start it up. Then, in , use the 'File' menu to choose the static directory (for the game you're playing).
* If isn't running start it up with: exult_studio -x (path to dir containing exult_studio.glade) -d (path to game directory)



4.6. What can you do at the moment?
* You can browse shapes in the main window.
* You can drag a shape from the shape browser to Exult, and that object will be placed in the game. (Note: Not all such objects are saved with the game yet; saving things like buildings will be implemented soon.)
* You can edit an 'egg' by double-clicking on it. An edit box should appear.
* You can create a new 'egg' using the pull-down menu in . In the Egg edit box, after you hit 'Apply', you'll be prompted to click in Exult where you want the egg to appear.
* If editing a 'monster' egg, you can set the monster by dragging the shape from the browser to the area that displays the monster.



4.7. What's next?
The next things to be implemented are:
* An NPC editor, similar to the one for Eggs (but with lots more stuff to set).
* A simple object editor, that lets you modify an object's 'quality', 'quantity' and flags.
* A 'save-map' function in Exult to save the whole map (not just the moveable objects that 'save-game' stores).



4.8. What's with this client/server stuff?
A map-editor needs to provide the ability to display the game, place objects on the map, and move objects around. That functionality is already in Exult, and it makes sense to reuse it. So we could have made Exult a part of . However, Exult is already a huge program, and is getting unwieldy to work on.
With this architecture, can have all the messy code for displaying/editing dialog boxes, while Exult only needs a little bit of work to handle requests.
Also, I (Jeff) wanted to get a little experience programming with sockets:-)

5. Bugs, known issues and not yet implemented features
5.1. Bugs
To see a list of open bugs and bugreports go to http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2335


5.2. How do I submit a proper bug report?
1. Read the Documentation and this FAQ to see if that is not allready covered and you have all set up correctly.
2. Before you report a bug to the bug tracker please try the latest snapshot. If the bug still occurs make sure that no one else allready reported the bug.
3. If you are not a sourceforge member please include your e-mail address this is important so we can get back to you. If you are a sourceforge member please log in before submitting a bug.
4. Make sense in the topic! For example, if the problem is with Rowenna in Skara Brae don't just choose "Skara Brae" in the topic. "BG: Rowenna crashes game" makes more sense. Sadly the space for the topics is limited. Explain the topic in "Detailed Description".
5. State which Operating System you use (Windows 9X, Linux, ...).
6. Please include a savegame (use common sense if it is really needed). You will find those in the game directories you put in the exult.cfg. They are called exult**bg.sav (** is a number) for BG and exult**si.sav for SI. Zip it (important as Sourceforge seems to have a size limit). As some parts of the game may require you to complete other quests or stuff before you get to the bug you want to report it's much easier for the team to look at the problem (speeds the process up a bit as they are much more likely you take a look at the problem this way).

So if you want to have a bug fixed follow these steps!


5.3. Known Issues
* Movement is sometimes jerky or slow.
* We don't know what all the data in 'weapons.dat' and 'ammo.dat' means, so hit points and damage don't work as well as in the original game.
* Sound effects in SI are sometimes odd with the wave pack as some sounds were coded in Exult to correspond to the sfx number in BG. This is a bug and will be addressed in due time.
* In Fellowship meetings some NPCs appear not to attend these though they should and sometimes even speak there. This is due to a bug in Exult which makes NPCs sit on already taken seats and only the top most NPC can be seen. Moving the top most via Hackmover makes the others visible.
* If you run a resolution higher than the original (320x200) some NPCs that are further away from the Avatar may seem to disappear and reappear when you get away or closer to them.
* With scalers enabled you might encounter slow downs of the game. The team is working on this right now and it is already a lot faster.
* The speech in the intro is out of synch with the lips animations. But now it matches the speed of the text.
* There are reported problems with digital sound effects or speech when using Vortex series sound cards (like the Diamond MX 300) under Win9x/ME. Exult is triggering a bug in the drivers. No workaround for now.



5.4. Not yet implemented
A few magic spells don't work yet.

6. Questions and Answers
6.1. How can I get answers concerning Ultima 7/Exult?
The best way to get answers to questions is to go to the Online discussion forum at: http://exult.sourceforge.net/forum/
To get answers concerning Ultima 7 in general go to the Ultima newsgroup: news://rec.games.computer.ultima.series
Or go to the Ultima Dragons homepage http://www.udic.org and find your way from there (this is an online Ultima fanclub)
Some Exult developers like to hang out on IRC on irc.openprojects.net, channel #exult.


6.2. How do I contact the author of this FAQ?
This FAQ is maintained by Dominus Dragon of the UDIC aka Dominik Reichardt. Feel free to contact me with improvements or complaints regarding the FAQ. I recently became part of the Exult Team though I only write the FAQ and don't code at all.

Exult homepage at http://exult.sourceforge.net/ Daily code snapshot at http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php Message board at http://exult.sourceforge.net/forum/ Bugreports to http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2335


7.2. Thanks
Of course big thanks go to the Exult Team for breathing life back into this jewel of a game.
Max Horn deserves my gratitude for making the FAQ easier to maintain via XML/XSL.
Thanks to all those I stole comments from without quoting them, those that sent me improvements and don't get quoted and so on. If you helped me in some way feel my gratitude without being mentioned.
Thanks go to Matt0 who really got me thinking about doing this FAQ (though he just did it to tease me).

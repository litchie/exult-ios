--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction 
  
1.1. What is Exult? 
Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But, being a DOS game with a very non-standard memory manager, it is difficult to run it on the latest computers. Exult is a project to create an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems, capable of using the data and graphics files that come with the game. 

Exult is being developed in C++ under Linux, MacOS and Windows using the SDL library to make porting to other platforms relatively easy. The current version supports much of the game's plot, allowing you to talk to NPCs, use items, solve quests, and even fight monsters. Music, speech, and the full introduction are also implemented. This, and further development, is only possible due to the work done by other fans who have decoded the various Ultima 7 data files, especially Gary Thompson, Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag. 

Exult aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993) play the game on modern hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing) its original splendor as is possible. You need to own Ultima 7: The Black Gate in order to use Exult, and we encourage you to buy a legal copy. 
 
  
1.2. Why is it called Exult - what is the meaning of this name? 
Jeff wrote on the Boards:
I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where the 'X' comes from. The ult, of course, comes from Ultima. It was only about 6 months ago that I replaced the X code with SDL, which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder to maintain that way. 

Ibrahim Holtzmann:
I'd like to point out that exult; is also an English verb that means to rejoice, to show extreme happiness. 
 
  
1.3. Where do I find Exult? 
The latest official version is found on http://exult.sourceforge.net/ 
Daily snapshots of the Win32 binary and of the CVS source tree can be found at http://io.spaceports.com/~kirben/ 
 
  
1.4. What is a snapshot? Are these screen shots or what? 
The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It is updated almost daily, sometimes twice a day. There is information on how to build your own binary of the source but there is also the newest pre-compiled Windows binary. 
 
  
1.5. How do I compile a source code snapshot under Linux? 
Install the latest version of SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)
Extract the Exult source code archive to ~/exult:
unzip Exult.zip -d ~ 
Create a fresh install of U7. I'll assume that you've installed U7 in ~/ultima7 
Run autogen.sh to create a configure script, then compile Exult:
cd ~/exult; chmod u+x autogen.sh; ./autogen.sh; ./configure; make 
Install Exult and the Exult data file:
cp exult ~/ultima7; mkdir ~/ultima7/data; cp ./data/exult.flx ~/ultima7/data 
Run Exult:
cd ~/ultima7; ./exult 
 
  
1.6. How do I compile a source code snapshot under Win 9x? 
The source code snapshots contain a file called README.win32 that explains everything. 
 
  
1.7. What is latest version of Exult? 
The current official release is V0.92 Alpha3. See also 1.3 to learn where to get the latest version. 

To find out which version you are running, press 'v' while in game. 
 
  
1.8. On what platform does Exult run? 
Exult should be able to be compiled (with minor modifications) on any platform that SDL supports. Right now the source can be compiled in Linux/i386, Linux/Alpha, MacOS, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, BeOS and Win32 (Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000). 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Exult and Ultima 7 
  
2.1. Do I need Ultima 7? 
Yes. Exult won't work without the original files. 
 
  
2.2. Does Exult work on all versions of the game? 
It seems to run most of the available versions of the game. The most common one nowadays with added Forge of Virtue runs for sure. 

However there are reported problems with the localized versions of the game (French, German and Spanish). Conversation threads don't seem to skip to the next line in the proper places and therefore are unreadable in some cases. SI was only published in English so no localization problems with that. 

V0.91 Alpha2 adds fixes for the french version, which should work now. No work has been done for the german version, due to lack of testers. If you have the German or Spanish version, and want it to run, contact us. 
 
  
2.3. How about Serpent Isle? 
The team is working on it. It is not yet fully playable but you can walk around, talk to some people... Paperdolls are working now and plotwise you will get quite far but you certainly won't be able to play through it yet. 

Colourless:
I can't say much about the what will happen except that a completely working Serpent Isle will be an annoying task to complete. It is close to BG in some ways, but very different in others. 

Jeff:
My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all the work so far on it. I'd much prefer to add enhancements to BG (which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG. Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals, that would change things. And also, since Exult is open-source, it would be fine if anyone wants to volunteer to work on SI. 
 
  
2.4. Do the Add-Ons work? 
Forge of Virtue (Add-On to Black Gate) is supported. Even though SI is not yet fully running the same holds true for The Silver Seed. 
 
  
2.5. Can you play through U7 yet? 
You can play through the Black Gate/Forge of Virtue without cheating and plotholes.
SI is partially playable since V0.91 Alpha2. 
 
  
2.6. Do savegames from the original work in Exult? 
Savegames that were made with the original Ultima 7 or U7Run don't work with Exult. You have to start a new game when you begin playing with Exult. Sorry! 
 
  
2.7. Where do I find Ultima 7 on the net to download? 
Don't! You may be able to find it on the net but it would be pirating the game and the Exult team doesn't support pirates. Look for the Ultima Collection in stores or on Ebay (http://www.ebay.com/). 

Don't ask the team for copies. 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Configurations, Resolution, Music 
  
3.1. What is it with the exult.cfg file? 
Most of the switches in the exult.cfg file are now handled via Setup when you start up Exult. For further understanding read the following descriptions. 

From the ReadMe:
The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should be simple to understand and modify. Take care though. Handling of syntax errors in this file is not well tested. Exult will create this file for you, with some sensible defaults, and you can then edit it to suit your preferences. 

okay, the default file looks like this (do not copy the **and following - these are my remarks).

3.2. What do I have to change in the Path-Settings? 
You have two choices on how to setup Exult.

The first one is very easy, just extract all the files from the compiled snapshot archive to the directory where you have The Black Gate or Serpent Isle installed. Concerning the paths you don't have to configure anything. 

The other is a little more complicated but appeals to control freaks like me:
Make a directory C:\Ultima7
make two subfolders named "Blackgate" and "Serpentisle" (without the quotes of course)
Extract or install the two Ultima 7 games into the appropiate folder (The Black Gate to C:\Ultima7\Blackgate and Serpent Isle to C:\Ultima7\Serpentisle)
Extract the compiled Exult to C:\Ultima7
Now you have to edit the exult.cfg file like this: 

<disk> 
<data_path> 
data 
</data_path> 
<game> 
<blackgate> 
<path> 
./Blackgate 
</path> 
<title> 
blackgate 
</title> 
</blackgate> 
<serpentisle> 
<path> 
./Serpentisle 
</path> 
</serpentisle> 
</game> 
</disk> 

You can either use the relative (./Blackgate) or absolute (C:\Ultima\Blackgate) path to point to the correct directory. 

Word of advice: Don't copy the files from the one game into the directory of the other. 
 
  
3.3. Do music and sound effects play? 
Yes. Music plays via MIDI and sounds quite like the original. Sound effects either play via digital (.wav) SFX or also via Midi. Even speech is supported.
You can change the way the music and the sound effects play via the setup menu or the exult.cfg file. 
 
  
3.4. The sound effects sound horrible 
Well the music plays okay but the sound effects sound horrible, especially when opening a door. What's up? 

This is due to the fact that the SFX is played using MIDI. For that to work properly you need the proper soundfont selected for your card. Not every soundcard supports soundfont-managing. Creative's AWE and Live! series do support it.
If your card doesn't or you want to hear better sfx you are much better off when you select wave sfx. The next section 3.5 covers that!
If you have on of those cards that do allow soundfont-managing this is how you should get some decent sound out of it (description only for Win32): 

Load up the Control Panel, select Multimedia Properties (or Sounds and Multimedia). Make sure that the MIDI playback device is the right one. For the SB Live! it has to be SB Live! MIDI Synth. Don't choose Microsoft Synth or similar. 
You need a Sound Font Manager. Creative either provides the AWE-Control panel or the Vienna Sound Font Manager, other sound card producers should have something similar. There also should be some Soundfont files (*.sf2 or *.sbk) 
Select Bank: 000 or Synth
Load 4gmgsmt.sf2 or similar (You may have to try around a bit). 
Now go into the game and test how the music works and if the SoundFX sound okay. 
 
  
3.5. How do I enable Exult to play wave Sfx? 
You have to set a path to the sfx pack in the waves settings in exult.cfg (see 3.1). If you leave this blank the sfx will be played through midi. For now there is only one pack and as the sfx in BG and SI varies a bit it's probably better if you don't configure SI to use it (leave the wave settings blank so the sfx is played throug midi). 

The sfx pack made by Joseph Morris can be found at http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/exult/jmsfx.zip (4.55 MB). He recorded the original 114 sfx used in Black Gate which must have been a lot of work. If your soundcard doesn't support soundfonts this pack is a must-have. Enjoy! 
 
  
3.6. How to turn of audio? 
Press 's' (or 'Esc' in snapshots dated 29.04.2001 or later) to turn on/off Music, Speech and SoundFX or change the settings in exult.cfg - see 3.1. 
 
  
3.7. What does the Scale option mean? 
By default Exult runs at 320x200 (which is the resolution the original Ultima VII used). Exult uses different scaling engines to double the size to 640x400 and increase the quality of the graphics. More information on the excellent scaling engine by Derek Liauw is available at http://members.xoom.com/derek_liauw/. The scalers also work with higher resolutions. To change the scaling method either use the Exult menu or change your exult.cfg - see 3.1. "2xSaI" is the new scaler, "bilinear" is the old one, "point" duplicates the pixels, "interlaced" is the same as "point" except misses every other line, "SuperEagle" is another scaler by Derek (the author of 2xSaI). Try them out to see how they look and which you like best. 

Your screen should be set to 16-bit color mode. 

Within the game you can use the 'Alt +' and 'Alt -' to switch resolution. The game will save the last selected mode and reuse it the next time you run Exult. 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Keyboard Commands, Miscellaneous 
  
4.1. What are the keys used in Exult? 
Starting with V0.91 Alpha2 all key commands can be changed. However, there is a default setting which closely follows the original with the addition of some improvements. 

To change your key bindings first edit the file defaultkeys.txt in your Exult directory, change the bindings and save the file (e.g. as my_keys.txt). Now you have to change exult.cfg to use that file. You can even choose if you want to change your key bindings for BG or SI. See the keys settings at 3.1. Change (default) to my_keys.txt. 

During the game press 'h' to see a help screen with all the keys (for MacOS change Alt for Cmd - the in-game help screen shows the correct key combination for MacOS). 

Default keyboard commands 
+/-   Change brightness (you may have to use the keypad) 
F4   Toggle fullscreen 
b   Use spellbook 
c   Combat mode 
f   Use food 
h   Show list of keyboard commands 
i   Show inventory

m   Show map 
p   Use lockpicks 
Alt-q   Exit game 
Ctrl-r   Quick restore 
Ctrl-Alt-s   Screenshot 
Ctrl-s   Quick save 
s   Show save/load box 
Esc   Show Game menu box and closes all open boxes 
t   Target, instead of double clicking, shows a cursor and pauses the game until you click on something 
v   About screen 
w   Use watch, shows the time if you got a watch 
Alt-x   Exit game 
z   Show stats 

In conversations you now have the ability not just click on the answer with the mouse but also to use the numeric keys. The response options aren't numbered visually but logically with the dots. Also press 'Esc' to select bye if possible. 
 
  
4.2. I remember that there were Cheat codes for the original. Does Exult support these? 
Not exactly in the same way, but a lot better.; press 'ctrl-h' during the game to see a help screen with all the cheat keys. 

Cheat commands

Ctrl-Alt-p   Pick pocket cheat, when enabled double-clicking on a NPC displays the actors inventory 
Ctrl-n   NPC number, When enabled, clicking an a NPC will display their number instead of their name. Usefull for the cheat screen. 
 
  
4.3. Do the various cheat rooms work? 
Yes. 
 
  
4.4. Where Do I find them 
Just keep on looking for them :-) 
 
  
4.5. Do the carriages, ships and the magic carpet work? 
Yes. The sail of ships look odd sometimes but otherwise these means of transportations work quite well. 
 
  
4.6. Serpent Isle had many more improvements over Black Gate (keyring, better paperdoll...). Will these be implemented?  
Right now the main goal is to get the Black Gate 100% working. After that it could be that some more things will be improved as far as it is possible to implement these. 

The keyring is not in Black Gate but there is the 'k' key which tries all the keys in the inventory to open a lock. 

Recently Ryan added paperdoll support in Black Gate. Though it is still buggy (some items disappear to Neverneverland) it is beautiful to look at. Very impressive. For this you need to have Serpent Isle installed on your hard drive and you must set the path to it in exult.cfg (see 3.2). If an item seems to have disappeared press 'F2' to activate the cheat menu and disable Paperdolls. Now you should find that missing item in your inventory. 
 
  
4.7. Any other improvements/features? 
In recent snapshots (since 29th of April) a new game menu was added with an improved sound settings box and a very much improved (awesome) savegame box. This allows you much more savegames than the original (you should run out of disc space before you run out of savegame slots), shows a screenshot of the location you saved at, the members of your party, your stats, game time and the date you actually saved. The game menu is opened via 'Esc' and the save game box is opened either via the game menu or the 's' key. 

In exult, you can still move your party even if there is a box/body/stats open/on. In the original, the world was kind of frozen. Now it is only frozen if you hit the 't' or 's' key. 
 
  
4.8. How do I disable all improvements?  
To get an Ultima 7 that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible there are several things to do (though I wonder why you'd want to do that): 

make custom keybindings files (see 4.1) in which you disable all the keys that were not in the original for Black Gate and Serpents Isle. In snapshots dated 29.04.2001 or later you have to assign 's' to old_file_gump to enable the old savegame menu (the line in your custom keybindings file should look like: S old_file_gump) 
Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys. 
Don't set the path to the Serpent Isle files (see 3.2) and put SI and a second copy of Exult in a seperate directory (note: you can no longer launch both BG and SI from the same exult.exe). This disables SI paperdolls in BG. 
Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and disable scalers. 
The disc icon in the Avatar paperdoll opens the new game menu. As of now this cannot be altered. Sorry! 
 
  
4.9. I heard that Exult is meant to be a game engine. Can I make my own game with Exult?  
Work has begun on Exult Studio which is aimed to be an editor for all kinds of files that are used by Ultima 7. As of now there is already a Gimp plug-in to edit shapes. 

Jeff:
As for the future, my main plan is to add editing capabilities, with the long-range goal of writing an original RPG.

5. Bugs, known issues, and not yet implemented features 
  
5.1. Bugs 
To see a list of open bugs and bugreports go to http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2335 
 
  
5.2. Known Issues 
Movement is sometimes jerky or slow. 
We don't know what all the data in 'weapons.dat' and 'ammo.dat' means, so hit points and damage don't work as well as in the original game. 
 
  
5.3. Not yet implemented 
Maybe a few magic spells that don't work 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Questions and Answers, Bugreports 
  
6.1. How can I get answers concerning Ultima 7/Exult? Where should I send Bugreports? 
The best way to get answers to questions is to go to the Online discussion forum at:
http://www.jackchaos.com/cgi-bin/UltraBoard/UltraBoard.pl?Action=ShowBoard&Board=exult 

The best way to submit bugreports is to use Sourceforge's bug database at:
http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2335 

To get answers concerning Ultima 7 in general go to the Ultima newsgroup:
news://rec.games.computer.ultima.series 

Or go to the Ultima Dragons homepage http://www.udic.org and find your way from there (this is an online Ultima fanclub) 

Some Exult developers like to hang out on IRC on irc.openprojects.net, channel #exult. 
 
  
6.2. How do I contact the author of this FAQ? 
This FAQ is maintained by Dominus Dragon of the UDIC (http://www.udic.org/) aka Dominik Reichardt (gigdr@tesionmail.de). Feel free to contact me with improvements or complaints regarding the FAQ. I recently became part of the Exult Team though I only write the FAQ and don't code at all.

7.2. Thanks 
Of course big thanks go to the Exult-Team for breathing life back into this jewel of a game. 

Max Horn deserves my gratitude for making the FAQ easier to maintain via XML/XSL. 

Thanks to all those I stole comments from without quoting them, those that sent me improvements and don't get quoted and so on. If you helped me in some way feel my gratitude without being mentioned. 

Thanks go to Matt0 who really got me thinking about doing this FAQ (though he just did it to tease me).

SourceForge Island Mod Readme
========================================================

This is a small mod with an island is just off the Trinsic 
coast and a subquest involving the lost FAQ.
To get to the new island we hid a teleporter in Trinsic, 
between the two houses in the same street as Christopher's forge.
You may have to walk a bit back and forth between the houses to 
trigger the teleport.

This mod was originally started to showcase Exult Studio and show 
the faces of the Exult developers. Eventually only Dominus showed 
his face.

Nowadays the BG Keyring mod is a much much better showcase.

1	About this document
-----------------------
Author: Marzo Sette Torres Junior
e-mail: marzojr@yahoo.com
version: 0.11.24

	This mod (the so called "Keyring Mod") contains a lot of small
	modifications to the Ultima 7: Black Gate game WITH the Forge
	of Virtue add-on. There are also a number of not-so-small changes.
	There is a lot of original usecode and art in the mod too.

	There are many acknowledgements I have to make. One is for Team
	Lazarus; I borrowed some ideas for the Shrines and Codex from
	them. The other acknowledgements are to those that gave me some
	useful suggestions in the old Phorum thread. They are Crysta the Elf,
	gruck, Gradilla Dragon, Dominus and Artaxerxes.

	I must also thank Crysta the Elf for some graphics she made/edited.
	The full list is in the version history, below.

	Also, the structure of the mod is based on Alun Bestor's Quests and
	Iteractions mod.

2	Installing the mod
----------------------
	First, I must be explicit that I have tested this mod *only* with
	Forge of Virtue add-on installed; it will *not* work without that
	add-on since it uses some of the add-on's data.

	Secondly (and just as importantly), this mod is will *not* work in
	Exult 1.2, nor it will work on any but *the* latest snapshots. There
	were some bugs I had to fix to get everything working as is.

	With that out of the way: to install the mod, simply unzip the contents
	of the zip file into your Black Gate's 'mods' folder. By default (that
	is, unless you changed it specifically in your 'Exult.cfg' file), this
	would be the 'mods' subdirectory of the path you set for Black Gate in
	your 'Exult.cfg' file. If the folder is not there, simply create an empty
	folder called 'mods' in your Black Gate directory and proceed as above.
	
	There are two optional (but highly recommended) additional steps you may
	want to perform:

	OPTIONAL: You can create a shortcut to start Exult directly in the
	Keyring mod. To do so, make sure that the command-line is similar to
	the following example:
		<path to Exult>\Exult --fov --mod Keyring
	You can use the supplied 'Keyring.ico' file for the shortcut (if you
	use Windows) or use the supplied 'Keyring.png' file to make your own
	icon for other OSes.

	OPTIONAL: This mod adds a custom keybinding *patch* file, which alters what
	two key combinations do:
		-- The 'K' key calls the Keyring, like SI;
		-- Again like SI, the 'Alt+K' combination tries all party keys.
	These changes are loaded by default. You can, if you like, edit these new
	key bindings to match your preferences; just edit the 'data/patchkeys.txt'
	file. This file will override your BG settings -- which is why it is such
	a small file -- but only for the Keyring mod.


3	Contributing to this mod
----------------------------
	If you have any bugs that you would like to see fixed -- or that you
	*have* fixed -- please send them to me! You can either e-mail them
	to me or you can post them in the Exult Phorum.

4	Using it in your own mods
-----------------------------
	You are free to use anything I have written in your own mods;
	I ask only that you give me proper credit -- and maybe tell me
	about the mod you are doing, as I might be interested enough to
	help and/or to include as a part of this mod.

	In previous releases of this mod, the mod's full source was included
	in the zip file. Starting with version 0.11.01, only the files required
	to play the mod are included. You can obtain the source of the mod in
	the Exult source code, available at the 'Downloads' page or through
	anonymous CVS. It is in the 'content/bgkeyring' directory.

5	What this mod does
----------------------
	The mod started out by adding a keyring to Black Gate. It has two
	new NPCs, several new items and graphics and the following things:
	- You can now meditate at the Shrines of the Virtues.
	- You can now view the Codex; you must be in a sacred quest, though.
	- A brand new Shrine of the Codex, based on the one at the Mysterious
	  Sosaria website.
	- The three items of Principles (Book of Truth, Candle of Love and
	  Bell of Courage), as well as the three Flames of Principles.
	- Lock Lake Cleanup: Once Miranda's bill is signed, the Lake will
	  be gradually cleaned up of garbage.
	- A brand new Shrine of Spirituality and a basement for Serpent's Hold,
	  where the Flame of Courage is located. Both are located in a new map,
	  thus using Exult's Multimap support.
	- An improved Orb of the Moons, allowing you to visit the shrines too.
	- Innkeepers will reclaim the room keys when you are leaving the inn.
	  They will also lock the doors and make the beds.
	- The rudiments of a brand-new spellcasting system which allows NPCs
	  to cast spells are now in place. Each NPC has his/her own spellcasting
	  item which can be used to cast spells, and they will use mana and
	  reagents. There are also some new NPC-only spells.
	- The 'Iteractions' mod by Alun Bestor; you can bake pastries, forge swords,
	  milk cows, shear sheep...
	- The 'Avatar Pack' mod by yours truly, with several shiny new portraits
	  for your avatar.
	- NPCs can now cast spells too! The system is very rudimentary yet, being
	  dialog based, but there are plans for major improvements in the future.
	- Lord British now has his Crown Jewels. They don't do everything they should
	  yet, but they are unbalanced already if you get your filthy hands on them.

6	Spoilers
------------
	So, you can't keep away... very well. Here they are. Proceed at your
	own peril...

	Keyring Spoilers
	----------------
		- The Quest is started by Zauriel. He is located just outside of
		  Lord British's castle. You can't miss him :-)
		- Most dialogs have a 'shortcut' out with no ill effects.
		- You must be very powerful to survive the quest.
		- Try hackmoving Laurianna to Zauriel without giving her some
		  blackrock first. Then talk to Zauriel.
		- It is Laurianna that will give you the keyring. She will only
		  do so *after* you give her Zauriel's Journal.
		- Using the keyring on the Avatar causes all party keys to be
		  added to it.

	Shrines of Virtues
	------------------
		- The Shrine of Sacrifice starts out defiled; you can restore it
		  with the correct Word of Power.
		- Before cleasing the Shrine of Sacrifice, look for the "Book of
		  Forgotten Mantras" and take it with you. When you choose to say
		  a Mantra, you can also select those from the book.
		- After you meditate for the right amount of cycles and with the
		  right mantra, each shrine will give you a quest to go see the
		  Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.
		- After going through seven shrines, and if you don't have access
		  to the Shrine of Spirituality, you will be able to attune the
		  white Virtue Stone to the Shrine with the Codex. Be sure to
		  have a way out, or you may be trapped!
		- Returning to the Shrine after seeing the Codex gives you a reward.

	Shrine of the Codex
	-------------------
		- You can only enter if you are in a sacred quest.
		- You must have both lenses to view the Codex. You can double-click
		  the lenses to rotate them.
		- Be sure to carry the lenses with you, or they may be trapped inside
		  the shrine if you can no longer enter!
		- Returning the Items of Principles to their original places is the
		  right thing to do.
		- Try teleporting inside the Shrine and viewing the Codex when you are
		  not on a quest to see it.

	Improved Orb of the Moons
	-------------------------
		- You can now teleport to the Shrines too; just throw the orb far
		  from you. Here are the new destinations of the Orb:
		Honesty                         Compassion                  Valor

		                Moonglow        Britain         Jhelom

		Humility        New Magincia    (Avatar)        Yew         Justice

		                Skara Brae      Trinsic         Minoc

		Spirituality                    Honor                       Sacrifice

	Lock Lake Cleanup
	-----------------
		- Eventually, Mack's key will be in possession of Lord Heather. You
		  can ask him for it.

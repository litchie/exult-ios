This is the place for publicly available subplot patches and games created with
ExultStudio.

To install it, create a directory to serve as the 'patch' area for the Black Gate,
unpack this zip file there, and add a 'patch' directive to the 'exult.cfg' file 
as in the following example:

 <disk>
  <u7path>
  /home/jeff/exult
  </u7path>
  <data_path>
  /home/jeff/exult/data
  </data_path>
  <game>
   <blackgate>
    <path>
    /home/jeff/exult
    </path>
    <patch>
    /home/jeff/exult/data/bg/static
    </patch>
...

Now run Exult/Black Gate, start a new game, and you should find
yourself on a small island East of Trinsic with a 'mage' to talk to.
Or as was added recently you will find yourself at the "normal" starting position 
of BG in Trinsic. There is a teleporter between the two houses in the same 
street as Christopher's forge. This teleporter takes you to the island.

(When done, you might want to remove the patch files or the patch path in exult.cfg
so you can run the normal game again.)

...

To create the usecode out of the usecode.uc file you have to either grab "ucc.exe" from the tools-snapshot or build ucc from source.
Then run "ucc -o usecode usecode.uc" in the patch directory and you should have a file called usecode.

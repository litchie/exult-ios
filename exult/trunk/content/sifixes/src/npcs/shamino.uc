 *	I decided to reimplement Shamino's usecode entirely. I could have left some things
 *	for the original to handle, but it wouldn't allow me to do what I wanted: which
 *	was (1) to make him refuse to leave while on Spinebreaker Mountains and
 *	(2) fixing the bug that he doesn't add his exchanged items to the list.

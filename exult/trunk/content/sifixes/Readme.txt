1	About this document
-----------------------
Author: Marzo Sette Torres Junior
e-mail: marzojr@taskmail.com.br
version: 0.15.01

	This document fixes a few of the Usecode bugs that plague
	Ultima VII: Serpent Isle. I have tested it *only* with Silver Seed
	installed; while it *might* work without the add-on, I woudn't
	count on it.

	A potion of the code (the Cantra healing part) is heavily based
	on Usecode available with the Exult CVS code (it is the file
	located at "exult/content/si/usecode.uc"). I did some minor tweaks
	and some reorganization to make it more compatible with the rest of
	the mod's usecode. The main reason I am including it here is that
	I don't think many people would know about it otherwise...
	The Cantra cure was written by Jeff Freedman (aka "DrCode"), and
	has been split into the files "npcs/cantra.uc" and
	"items/bucketcure.uc".

	Everything else has been my own work, although the structure of
	the mod is based on Alun Bestor's Quests and Iteractions mod.
	Many fixes were based on the document found at
	"exult/docs/usecode_bugs.txt" on the CVS snapshot.

2	Installing the mod
----------------------
	First, I must be explicit that I have tested this mod *only*
	with Silver Seed add-on installed; I don't know if it will work
	or not without. It *might* work.
	Secondly (and just as importantly), this mod is only guaranteed
	to work on the latest Exult snapshots. It will *not* work in Exult 1.2.
	
	With that out of the way: there are two ways to install the mod:
	
	1) If you are using DOS/Windows, you can use the supplied batch files.
	   Unzip the mod to your Serpent's Isle folder (so that, for example,
	   the "Install.bat" file is at "SerpentIsle/SI Fixes/Install.bat").
	   Make sure that the mod's folder is at the same level as your
	   STATIC folder! Then run the "Install.bat" file to install. You 
	   can also run "Make & Install.bat" to compile the usecode and
	   install -- but you must have UCC to do so, and at a very
	   specific location too.
	2) Copy the contents of the "data" folder to your SI's PATCH folder.
	
3	Contributing to this mod
----------------------------
	If you have any bugs that you would like to see fixed -- or that you
	*have* fixed -- please send it to me! I would love to add these
	to the mod, so that SI can be made even better than it already is.
	Use the e-mail above.

4	Using it in your own mods
-----------------------------
	You are free to use anything I have written in your own mods;
	I ask only that you give me proper credit -- and maybe tell me
	about the mod you are doing, as I might be interested enough to
	help and/or to include as a part of this mod.

5	What this mod does
----------------------
	As the title implies, this mod fixes SI usecode bugs. The way that
	they are fixed does not depend on starting a new game -- although
	if the save game is at a late enough part of the game, you will
	not see some of the fixes.

	Here are the specific bugs that this mod addresses so far:

	- Cantra's healing.
	- If you prefer 24-hour time, you can have it. Find the following
	  line in usecode.uc and remove the starting double-slash:
			//#include "items/time_tellers.uc";
	  You will have to recompile the usecode afterwards, but it is
	  not too hard.
	- After being cured of insanity, the Companions will thank the
	  Avatar for it. They will also join *before* Xenka is summoned.
	- Basement of Temple of Tolerance was mistakenly identified
	  as "Temple of Logic" by the "Locate" spell.
	- Gwenno can now receive the White Diamond Necklace from Iolo;
	- Gwenno will no longer try to talk to the Avatar when she is
	  resurrected;
	- Shamino will add his own misplaced items in the exchanged item
	  list when he joins;
	- On the same note, the moonsilk stockings and the filari also
	  appear on that list;
	- Fixed a few bugs on the exchanged item list when you find out
	  the origins of the items. Specifically, the lab apparatus,
	  the fur cap, the bear skull and the plain shield had a few problems.
	- The Pillars in Serpent's Fang Keep no longer teleport you to
	  the Test of Purity;
	- After the the Wall of Lights cutscene, you can no longer call
	  Thoxa to "resurrect" your possessed party. Or rather, you can
	  call her but she won't bring Iolo, Dupre and Shamino back as
	  they are the Banes now. Even if you have their bodies right
	  there -- or elsewhere.
	- Dupre can no longer be resurrected after he sacrifices himself.
	- Iolo, Shamino and Dupre will all refuse to leave the party while
	  you are on the Spinebreaker Mountains. They will also refuse
	  blue potions while there...
	- The Wall of Lights has been revamped also. There is nothing you
	  can do now to keep the companions out of it -- nothing I can
	  think of, at any rate. Considering that I *have* read the
	  anti-walkthrough from http://www.it-he.org, that is a lot. Also,
	  the companions don't dump every item directly to the ground when
	  they die -- items dropped remain in their respective containers.
	  Not really a bug, but was extremely annoying...
	- Fixes the Monitor Banquet so that the pikeman from the training
	  area will not disappear anymore.
	- Ghosts no longer talk as the Chaos Hierophant when double-clicked.
	- Fawn Tower is properly cleaned up. Goblins no longer spawn after
	  it is cleaned up (unless the banes have been released) and the
	  broken dishes all go away.
	- When you get Dupre's shield back from Luther, you now really give
	  him his shield back. The exchanged item list also registers that.
	- Iolo's lute is no longer duplicated by the Teleport Storm on
	  Fawn -- a regular lute appears instead.
	- Inn keys are now reclaimed by the innkeepers when you are leaving
	  the inn. They will lock the doors and make the beds too.
	  Innkeepers will also drop inn keys when the banes are released
	  (or, in Simon's case, when he is slain).
	- The Vibrate spell no longer makes you drop the Usecode container,
	  nor its contents.
	- The Firesnake spell finally *works* now! Tell me what you think
	  of it. Just make sure not to stand too close to your target...
	- Spells. In the original SI, there were no less than *four* "Ex Por"
	  spells, and a few other spells were out of synch with the manual.
	  Specifically:
		Spell			Original SI	Manual/This Mod
		=========================================================
		Unlock Magic		Ex Por		Ex Por
		Erstam's Surprise	Ex Por		Ex Jux Hur*
		Vibrate			Ex Por		Uus Des Por Grav*
		Imbalance		Ex Por		Kal Vas An Grav**
		Create Ammo		In Hur Sanct	In Jux Ylem
		Create Ice		In Sanct Grav	In Frio
		Fetch			An Frio Xen Ex	Por Ylem
		Serpent Bond		An Frio Xen Ex	Kal Frio Xen Ex
		Stop Storm		Rel Hur		An Hur
	  
	    *	Thanks to Neutronium Dragon for the suggestions.
	    **	Perhaps "Kal Vas In Grav" is a better fit to the spell...
	    
6	Version history
-------------------
version: 0.15.01
	- Fixed stupid bug I introduced while preventing Vibrate spell
	  from dropping Usecode container (basically, the spell would only

	  in revisions.
version: 0.15.00

	  was misidentified as being "Temple of Logic" by "Locate" spell.
	- Cantra's healing now actually works...
	- If you prefer 24-hour time, you can have it. Find the following

	  but it is not too hard.

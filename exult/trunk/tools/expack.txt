Expack Documentation
====================
By Marc Winterrowd

Expack is a command-line utility that lets you extract and create Flex files.
Flex files (which are, like directories, "containers" for other files) are used by Ultima 7 to store most of its data.
Expack currently supports 5 modes of operation:


Add
===

--NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.  FUTURE ENHANCEMENT--

This command adds one or more files to the end of a Flex file.

Syntax:
expack -a flexfile input_file_1 ... input_file_n

Examples:
expack -a animals.flx bee.wav   (add 1 file)
expack -a animals.flx hamster.wav rattlesnake.wav donkey.wav   (add 3 files)


Create
======
This command takes many files and bundles them into a single Flex file.

Syntax:
expack -c new_flexfile input_file_1 ... input_file_n

Example:
expack -c animals.flx ducky.wav kitty.wav moocow.wav doggy.wav


Extract
=======
The "extract" command lets you extract either one or all of the files contained within a Flex file.
The extracted files will have the extension ".u7o"

Syntax:
expack -x flexfile index   (extracts a single file)
expack -x flexfile   (extracts all files)

Examples:
expack -x text.flx 17
expack -x text.flx


"Input" (is that what -i stands for?)
=====================================
This command is similar the create command - it creates a new Flex file from a number of input files.
However, this command doesn't read the names of the input files from the command line - instead, it reads them from a text file.

Syntax:
expack -i info_file

Example:
expack -i wavlist

The info file (which is a plain text file) looks like this:

Info File Syntax:
-----------------
flexfile_name
input_file_1
.
.
.
input_file_n

Info File Example:
------------------
jmsfx.flx
0.wav
.
.
.
114.wav


List
====
This command lists the contents of a Flex file.
It gives you the number of files contained within the Flex file, as well as the length of each file.

Syntax:
expack -l flexfile

Example:
expack -l text.flx

This file is currently a random pile of useful information... someday it'll
be ordered in a coherent format.

* Error: "error: could not locate */Docs/opcodes.txt. exiting"
	ucxt needs to find the abovementioned file for details of the
	opcodes. You either need to run ucxt in the path exult/usecode/ucxt
	or add the following to exult.cfg:

	(inside the <config> tag)
	 <ucxt>
	  <root>
	  (the path to ucxt goes here (eg: /home/pb/exult/usecode/ucxt))
	  </root>
	 <ucxt>

* Error: "Failed to locate usecode file. Exiting."
	ucxt attempts to locate the exult.cfg file to find the locations
	of black gate (ultima7) and serpent isle (serpent).

	ucxt hunts for the usecode file under all permutations of the
	following filenamesthe following filenames:

		$MAINPATH = (bg path from exult.cfg) | (si path from exult.cfg)
			| "ultima7" | "ULTIMA7" | "serpent" | "SERPENT"
		$STATICPATH = "static" | "STATIC"
		$USECODENAME = "usecode" | "USECODE"

		$MAINPATH/$STATICPATH/$USECODE
		$STATICPATH/$USECODE
		$USECODE

	It also searches under:
		
		usecode.u7
		usecode.si

	It's a mess, but I'm trying to be thorough. <grin>

be ordered in a coherent format.

* Error: "error: could not locate */Docs/opcodes.txt. exiting"
	ucxt needs to find the abovementioned file for details of the
	opcodes. You either need to run ucxt in the path exult/usecode/ucxt
	or add the following to exult.cfg:

	(inside the <config> tag)
	 <ucxt>
	  <root>
	  (the path to ucxt goes here (eg: /home/pb/exult/usecode/ucxt))
	  </root>
	 <ucxt>

* Error: "Failed to locate usecode file. Exiting."
	ucxt attempts to locate the exult.cfg file to find the locations
	of black gate (ultima7) and serpent isle (serpent).

	ucxt hunts for the usecode file under all permutations of the
	following filenamesthe following filenames:

		$MAINPATH = (bg path from exult.cfg) | (si path from exult.cfg)
			| "ultima7" | "ULTIMA7" | "serpent" | "SERPENT"
		$STATICPATH = "static" | "STATIC"
		$USECODENAME = "usecode" | "USECODE"

		$MAINPATH/$STATICPATH/$USECODE
		$STATICPATH/$USECODE
		$USECODE

	It also searches under:
		
		usecode.u7
		usecode.si

	It's a mess, but I'm trying to be thorough. <grin>

 History:
 - originally written June 99 by Maxim S. Shatskih aka Moscow Dragon (maxim__s@mtu-net.ru)
 Thanks to Keldon Jones (keldon@umr.edu)
  and Wouter Dijklslag aka Wody Dragon (wody@wody.demon.nl) for their help
 11-Oct-99
  - added "function search by opcode & intrinsic" feature
  - added "unknown opcode & intrinsic counting" feature
 12-Oct-99
  - the good deal of intrinsic functions is now known

 See source file comments for the description of usecode opcodes & intrinsic functions
  (the latter one differs between BG & SI)

 Some general usecode ideas:
 - usecode functions 0x0-0x3ff are shape handlers - called on double-clicks & other
  event with appropriate shapes
 - usecode functions 0x401-0x4ff are NPC handlers - called on double-clicks & other
  event with appropriate NPCs - NPCID + 0x400 (401 for Iolo, 417 for LB etc).
 - usecode functions 0x500-0x5ff is for Wisps & guards (nonNPC characters able to talk)
  (these ranges seems to be hardcoded)
 - stack machine used to execute bytecodes
 - the machine's state is:
  stack
  local variables(forgotten on function exit, first N of them are call arguments -
          first pushed is 0, next are 1, 2...)
  game flags
  ItemRef (???seems to be valid only for top-level functions-event handlers
        or maybe is persistent till quitting usecode executuion???)
  EventID (???seems to be valid only for top-level functions-event handlers
        or maybe is persistent till quitting usecode executuion???)
 - game flags are bytes treated as booleans (0/1), persistent across engine shutdown/restart
  and stored as a simple array (??? 0 or 1 based. Don't remember. Flag 3 means
  - Tetrahedron is down, flag 4 means - Sphere is down) in GAMEDAT\FLAGINIT.
 - usecode can also manipulate items & NPCs by means of intrinsic functions
 - "add" opcode can sum strings (concatenation). Also it can add integer to string
 - any array operations can be peformed on scalar values. In fact, each scalar value is
  treated by the array operations as an array with a single element. Vice versa is also
  true - for instance, ItemsNearItem() function returns an array. Sometimes it is used in
  enum/next loop as an array, but sometimes it is used as an itemref.
 - array indices are 1-based as in VB
 - itemref is a unique ID of the given item. For NPCs, itemref is (-NPCID). For other items,
  itemrefs seems to be non-persistent (not saved to savegame & re-invented on each
  engine startup)??? indexes into engine's item lists
 - there is a value called "referent" which identifies item & stored in U7IBUF
    Maybe Itemref is the same thing?
 - -356 is always an Itemref for Avatar. So, Avatar's NPC ID is possibly 356.
 - usecode execution starts from the event handler function. It is called by the engine
  without arguments (double-click) in some cases. ItemRef & EventID are set before entering usecode.
 - the easiest case is double-click on some item. In this case, a usecode event handler
  function called. Function ID usually matches the shape's Type number
  or is (NPCID + 0x400) for NPCs.
  ItemRef is set to the item double-clicked, EventID is set to 1 (double-click).
 - other causes for the engine to call usecode function:
  - events scheduled by intrinsic functions 1 & 2 have EventID 2
  - item is put on another item - the underlying item's handler is called with EventID 3
    (Penumbra's plaque)
  - usecode Egg - also calls a function with EventID 3
  - use item as a weapon (flammable oil) - EventID 4
  - NPC being beaten to death (examples: Hook in BG, Dracothaxus in FoV,
          Pomdirgun & Rotoluncia in SI) - 7 in SI???
  - Avatar & NPC approaching to some distance??? - 9 in SI
 - hex coords to sextant coords - ( x - 933 ) / 10, ( y - 1134 ) / 10

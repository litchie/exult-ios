be ordered in a coherent format.


* Error: "Failed to locate usecode file. Exiting."
	ucxt hunts for the usecode file under the following filenames:
		usecode
		usecode.u7
		usecode.si
		ultima7/static/usecode
		serpent/static/usecode
		ULTIMA7/STATIC/USECODE
		SERPENT/STATIC/USECODE
	Relative to the directory it is run in, and in that order, fixing it
	so it works nicer is on my "TODO" list. Integrating ucxt into the main
	config file would probably be a good idea.

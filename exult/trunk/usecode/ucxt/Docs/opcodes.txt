# A "false" value is defined as integer 0, a null string, or an empty array.
# (stateing obvious) Logically a "true" value would be the opposite of this.

# "Truth value"s pushed on the stack are integer 1 for true, and integer 0
# for false.

# REMEMBER: All arrays are indexed with as 1 based rather then 0 based.

# NOTE: Description of function appears below the relevant function.

TODO: To be done...
* {varoffset} is the array to loop over.
* {short}(1st) is used to store the "counter".
* {short}(2nd) is used to store the "max" value. Which is the number of elements
  stored in {varoffset} or 1 if it's a string or integer.
* {offset} is the relative offset to jump to after the loop is completed.

any of the previous CMPSs since the last ASK.

> 0x08	NULL	"null"	"null()"	0	{}

strings are concatenated, collections are appended.

> 0x0A	SUB	"sub"	"sub()"	0	{}

Pops two values from the stack (pop v2, then pop v1), subtracts them
from each other (v1 - v2) then pushes the result to the stack. Only works
with integers.

Pops two values from the stack (pop v2, then pop v1), divides v1 by v2
(v1 / v2), then pushes the result to the stack. Only works with integers.

the stack (multiplication is commutative). Only works with integers.

Pops two elements from the stack (pop v2, then pop v1), mods v1 by v2
(v1 % v2), then pushes the result on the stack. Only works with integers.

> 0x0E	AND	"and"	"and()"	0	{}

Pops two elements from the stack, converts them to true/false, logically
"and"s the values, and pushes the resulting truth value back on the stack
as a 1/0(true/false).

> 0x0F	OR	"or"	"or()"	0	{}

The "logical or" counterpart the the "logical and" (opcode 0x0E). Refer to
that opcode for more information.

> 0x10	NOT	"not"	"not()"	0	{}

Pops one element from the stack converts it to a truth value, logically "not"s
it, and then pushes the resulting truth value on the stack.

> 0x12	POP	"pop\t[%1]"	"pop()"	2	{varoffset}

Pops one element from the stack and assigns it to the local varitable pointed

Pops {short} number of elements from the stack, and creates an array of
them, first off the stack is the first appended to the end of the array
(ie. the elements were appended originally to the stack in the order 3, 2,
1 would create an array of the form {1, 2, 3}). The created array is then
appended to the stack.

> 0x1F	PUSHI	"pushi\t%1H"	"pushi()"	2	{short}

Pushes the element {short} to the stack as a signed 16bit integer.

> 0x24	CALL	"call\textern:[%1]"	"call()"	2	{extoffset}

References the "external usecode function table" (Exult code calls this
"externals"), with the {extoffset} value passed in the opcode call
(eg: external_table[extoffset]), then "calls" that function to continue
execution.

> 0x25	RET	"ret"	"ret()"	0	{}

Returns to the "caller" function, after showing any text remaining in the
string buffer (Exult: say_string() buffer). Does not return any elements
on the stack (ie: returns "void").

> 0x26	AIDX	"aid\t[%1]"	"aidx()"	2	{varoffset}

Pops one (pop v1) element off the stack (the array index), and uses it as an
index of the local variable {varoffset}. (varoffset[v1]) The element obtained
is then pushed onto the stack.
TODO: NOTE: This opcode has been changed... need to redocument.

Appends the local variable pointed to by {varoffset} onto the end of the
string register.

> 0x30	IN	"in"	"in()"	0	{}

Tests if a value is in an array. Pops two elements from the stack (pop v1,
then pop v2) test if any of the elements inside the array v1 are equal to
the element v2 (v2 cannot be an array), and pushes the resulting truth value
on the stack.

> 0x31	SMTH	"smth\t%1 %r2"	"smth()"	4	{short,offset}

Does something related to conversations. Only occurs (2x) in the usecode
function handling the 'audition' in Britain. Current implementation
produces same result as original, although we're unsure of the exact
function of this opcode.

> 0x32	RTS	"rts"	"rts()"	0	{}

(ucdump calls this "retr")  Same as RET except pushes the return register
onto the stack before returning.
EXULT NOTE: unlike ret, it doesn't show any remaining text in the string
buffer. Bug?

> 0x33	SAY	"say"	"say()"	0	{}

Displays the string register to the screen (as appropriate talk, sign, scroll,
book, whatever). Has the side effect of clearing the string register.

> 0x34	NULL	"null"	"null()"	0	{}

> 0x35	NULL	"null"	"null()"	0	{}

> 0x38	CALLIS	"callis\t%1@%b2"	"callis()"	3	{short,byte}

Calls the intrinsic {short} with {byte} number of parameters popped from the
stack passed to it. Eg: if you were calling intrinsic 23 (short) with 3 (byte)
parameters, and the stack looked like this: {4, 3, 2, 1} (4 was the first
element pushed upon the stack), the intrinsic function call in a c-like form
would look like: intrinsic23( 1, 2, 3);

The intrinsic called will return a value on the stack.

The intrinsic called also has the same "event" flag as the caller function.

> 0x39	CALLI	"calli\t%1@%b2"	"calli()"	3	{short,byte}

Same as opcode CALLIS (0x38), except no return value.

> 0x3D	NULL	"null"	"null()"	0	{}

> 0x3E	PUSHITM	"pushitm"	"pushitm()"	0	{}

(ucdump & exult call this "push itemref") Pushes the identifier of the item
(for which the usecode event handler is called) onto the stack.

> 0x3F	ABRT	"abrt"	"abrt()"	0	{}

(ucdump calles this "exit") (exult says this is "really like a throw") Shows
any text in the string register, and exits the function immediatly.
TODO: Does it exit just this function, or all the called functions as well?

> 0x40 END_CONV "end_conv" "end_conv()"	0 {}

Always seems to be called right before a "goodbye", so guessing
it means 'end conversation'.

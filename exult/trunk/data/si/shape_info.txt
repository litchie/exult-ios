%%section shape_sfx
#	Format
#		:shapenum/sfxnum/delay/range/rand
#	Only the first two parameters are required.
#	delay is a flag (either 0 or 1) which indicates extra delay
#	between successive plays. If it is 1 and the shape does *not*
#	have an associated animation (e.g., cavern), there will be
#	a random delay. If the shape *does* have an associated animation,
#	this flag will be ignored.
#	range is used to specify a sequence of different sfx used by the
#	shape: Exult will play sfx ranging from sfxnum to sfxnum + range - 1.
#	rand is a flag controlling how range is used: if rand is 1, Exult
#	will randomly play one sfx in the range; if rand is 0, Exult will
#	play them sequentially, wrapping back to the first sfx.

%%section animation
#	The dafault animation starts at frame 0, goes through all
#	frames and returns to frame 0 again. This list is only for
#	animations which are NOT like that.
#
#	Format
#
#	Wrapping Loop
#		:shapenum/0/first_frame/frame_count/offset/frame_delay/sfx_delay
#
#	For the looping cycles, the animation starts at first_frame,
#	goes through frame_count frames (including the first one)
#	and returns to first_frame. offset is an overall phase
#	shift in the animation. If offset is '%', then Exult will
#	calculate offset as being sframe % frame_count, where sframe
#	is the frame with which the animation was created.
#	If offset is '-1' or if it is ommited, Exult will set it equal
#	to sframe.
#	frame_delay is an additional frame delay; time between frames
#	is multiplied by frame_delay. A value of zero is treated as 1.
#	sfx_delay indicates the delay (in frames) before the sfx
#	is played again. If it is '0' (or ommited) then sfx will be
#	played continuously; if '1' it will play every other frame, etc.
#	The sfx will always be played at first_frame. If sfx_delay is -1,
#	the sound effect will be synchronized with the animation, playing
#	whenever first_frame is being displayed.
#
#	Hourly (Sundials)
#		:shapenum/1
#
#	Hourly cycles display the frame equal to the current game hour
#	(24-hour format); the shape should have 24 frames.
#
#	Nonlooping (Energy fields)
#		:shapenum/2
#
#	These cycles start at frame 0 and stop at the last frame
#	of the shape. They do not wrap around to the first frame.
#
#	Random loops (bubbles)
#		:shapenum/3/first_frame/frame_count
#
#	Random loops work similar to Wrapping loops; the main
#	difference being that the animation stays at first_frame
#	for random periods of time before continuing. If the shape
#	has a sfx specified, this sfx will play in synch with the
#	animation.
#
#	Looping Recycle
#		:shapenum/4/first_frame/frame_count/recycle/sfx_delay
#
#	This is similar to the normal looping cycle. The difference is
#	that, after the first cycle, the animation will continue from
#	recycle instead of first_frame. Only sfx_delay is optional.

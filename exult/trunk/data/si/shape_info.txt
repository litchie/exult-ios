#Sundials

#Energy fields

#The dafault animation starts at frame 0, goes through all
#frames and returns to frame 0 again. This list is only for
#animations which are NOT like that.
#For other animation cycles, the animation starts at
#first_frame, goes through frame_count frames (including the
#first one) and returns to first_frame. offset is an overall
#phase shift in the animation. If offset is '%', then Exult
#will calc offset as sframe%frame_count, where sframe is the
#frame with which the animation was created. If offset is
#ommited, Exult will set it equal to sframe.

#	If a shape is not in the list below, it will use the 'default'
#	explosion (spritenum 5) with no sound effect (sfxnum -1).
#   You can leave sfxnum out, in which case there will be no SFX.

%%section shape_sfx
#	Format
#		:shapenum/sfxnum/chance/range/rand/extra
#	Only the first two parameters are required.
#	chance is the % chance of playing the sfx at any given moment.
#	Values of chance not in the [1-100] interval are treated as 100.
#	range is used to specify a sequence of different sfx used by the
#	shape: Exult will play sfx ranging from sfxnum to sfxnum + range - 1.
#	rand is a flag controlling how range is used: if rand is 1, Exult
#	will randomly play one sfx in the range; if rand is 0, Exult will
#	play them sequentially, wrapping back to the first sfx.
#	extra is basicall for the grandfather clock. It is a SFX that will
#	play every game hour a number of times equal to hour % 12 (or
#	twelve times for midnight).

%%section animation
#	The "default" animation starts at frame 0, goes through all
#	frames and returns to frame 0 again. This list is only for
#	animations which are NOT like that.
#
#	Format
#
#	Time Synchronized Loop
#		:shapenum/0/frame_count/frame_delay/sfx_delay
#	Hourly Loop (e.g., Sundials)
#		:shapenum/1
#	Nonlooping (e.g., Energy fields)
#		:shapenum/2/frame_count/frame_delay/sfx_delay
#	Looping
#		:shapenum/3/frame_count/frame_delay/sfx_delay/freeze_first/recycle
#	Random Frames
#		:shapenum/4/frame_count/frame_delay/sfx_delay
#
#	frame_count is the number of frames in each animation cycle; that
#	is, the shape will be divided into sets of frame_count frames which
#	animate independently from each other. If this field is less than zero,
#	Exult will set it equal to the number of frames of the shape.
#
#	frame_delay is an additional frame delay; time between frames
#	is multiplied by frame_delay. MUST be positive.
#
#	sfx_delay indicates the delay (in frames) before the sfx
#	is played again. If it is zero or one, the sfx will be played
#	continuously; if it is negative, it will be played only synchronized
#	with the animation (this means frame 0 or 1; see freeze_first).
#	On all other cases, the sfx will be played every sfx_delay frames.
#
#	freeze_first is the % chance of advancing the first frame of the loop;
#	this means that if freeze_first is zero, the animation will stop at the
#	first frame. Converselly, if freeze_first is 100, it will always advance.
#
#	recycle is the offset at which the animation will resume after reaching
#	the last frame of the loop; for example, recycle 0 means the initial
#	frame of the loop, recycle 1 means the second frame of the loop, etc.
#
#	Since BG needs no data patches, this section is empty in this data file.

%%section effective_hps
#	Effective HPs for objects which otherwise don't have them
#	(e.g., doors, powder keg). If the object does not have
#	HPs, they default to being indestructable; the list below
#	is only for those which are *not* indestructable.
#
#	Format
#		:shapenum/frame/quality/hps
#
#	If frame is -1, this entry will be used for all frames.
#	Likewise, if quality is -1, the quality will be ignored.
#	If the object does not have a quality, it will also be
#	ignored (and treated as -1).
#	If hps are zero, the object will be indestructable.

%%section framenames
#
#	THIS SECTION SHOULD ***NOT*** BE EDITED MANUALLY!!!!!

#		:shapenum/frnum/qual/-1
#		:shapenum/frnum/qual/0/msgid
#		:shapenum/frnum/qual/type/msgid/defmsg
#
#	frnum is the frame for which the entry apllies, or < 0 for any frame.
#
#	qual is the quality for which the entry apllies, or < 0 for any quality.
#
#	If type is -255, use default shape name instead. If type is -1, display
#	no name at all. If type is 0, display msgid and that is it.
#
#	If type is 1 or 2, the name will be prefixed (type 1) or suffixed (type 2)
#	by the message indicated by extramsg.
#
#	If type is 3 or 4, the name will be prefixed (type 3) or suffixed (type 4)
#	by the corresponding NPC name. The corresponding NPC must have NPC # > 0,
#	not be unused and (for dead bodies) be met, or defmsg will be used instead.
#	For dead bodies, the corresponding NPC is the NPC to which it will become
#	when resurrected; for all others, this is the object's quality (hence, it
#	is limited to 255 NPCs and the object MUST have a quality).
#
#	msgid and defmsg are the name index in misc_names section of TEXT.FLX
#	or of TEXTMSG.TXT; for SI without SS, this is actually the corresponding
#	SS index. If defmsg is -1, the default name will be empty; if it is -255,
#	Exult will use the default shape name.
#
#	Food items.

Rewrite Event Loop
==================

We need one and only one event loop (maybe defined in an event class), with
methods for adding callbacks, etc.
Look at GTK+'s event loop code and mimic that.

What happens in the Exult event loop ?

	Handle mouse motion
	Handle mouse clicks
	Handle keypresses
	Handle configure events
	Rotate palettes
	
Garbage Collection
==================

We need to tag all shapes with a timestamp when they are displayed. Then we 
can have a task which is executed at regular intervals which invalidates
shapes which haven't been accessed in a while. Other more intelligent
mechanisms are welcome, though.

User-Defined Keystrokes
=======================

It would be good if users could assign custom keystrokes to certain actions.

Development Environment
=======================

Yeah, yeah...

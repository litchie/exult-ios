Exult Studio Documentation - Rough first draft
==============================================
 
  
NAME
====

exult_studio - a world editor for Exult 
  

SYNOPSIS
========

exult_studio [options] 

  
DESCRIPTION
===========

exult_studio can be used to view graphics and map snippets of Exult games. Used 
in conjunction with exult the map can be changed as well. 
Currently it is not feasable to create a game from scratch. You must point 
exult_studio at an existing game instead, either via the -d commandline option 
(see below), or by selecting Open static... in the File menu. The latter will 
pop up a file requester, where you can choose an appropriate directory. 
Once an appropriate directory has been located, a tree of game files is 
displayed to the left of the main window, while the currently selected file is 
viewed in detail to the right. At the moment, the following types of files are 
supported: 
  
Shape files
Shapes are the basic graphical elements of the game. Each shape has one or more 
frames that typically represent different states or angles of the same thing. 
E.g. a button shape could have frames for pressed, and released; a character 
could have frames depicting her sitting, standing up facing one way, or another, 
swinging a punch, etc. 
When a shape file is selected, the right part of the main window will show frame 
zero of the shapes contained therein. Shapes can be selected by clicking, which 
will show there number, number of frames, and name if known. Other frames can be 
viewed by changing the frame number. 
  
Map files
These files contain so called chunks that serve as templates in the final map. 
The chunks of the selected map file are shown to the right of the main window. 
  

OPTIONS
=======

  -d DIRECTORY
  specifies DIRECTORY as the game base directory. 
  -x DIRECTORY
  tells exult_studio to look in DIRECTORY for its user-interface specification. 
  This option is only useful to developers. 
  

FILES
=====

  /usr/share/exult/exult_studio.glade 
  Default location of the user-interface specification.

Editing a copyrighted game may or may not be allowed. Please exercise caution. 
  

BUGS
====

Closing the directory selector (via Ok or Cancel) induces a crash. Double 
clicking the directory works, just move the selector out of the way after that. 
Invalid arguments to commandline options will not be taken lightly. Avoid that 
for now. 

More bugs? Surely! Please report them at:

(Be sure to mention information about your operating system, and which version 
of exult_studio you are running!)

HISTORY
=======

exult_studio started it's life as a map-browser for Ultima VII and has evolved 
from there, thanks to the open source-model, and contributions of time and code 
from many people.

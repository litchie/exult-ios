			<header>What is <Studio/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> is not only capable of playing Ultima 7 but it is also intended as
					an engine in the style of the one used by Ultima 7. <Studio/> started it's life
					as a simple map editor but it is slowly developing into a full fledged editor
					enabling users to create a new game. Tristan came up with the cool name!
				</para>
				<para>
					Currently there are many steps required to create a new game but at the moment 
					the main goal of Jeff is to make it as user-friendly as possible.
				</para>
				<para>
					Editing a copyrighted game may or may not be allowed. Please exercise caution especially
					if you want to distribute your changes.

			<header>About this Documentation.</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Studio/> is work in progress. How things work may change and new features are
					added very frequently. Due to the lazy nature of the maintainer (Dominus) of this
					documentation it might not always be up to date. As we do not have an official 
					release yet this documentation refers to recent snapshots.
				</para>
				<para>
				Note that you also need an up to date (aka recent snapshot) version of <Exult/> to
				have <Studio/> working properly. The snapshot has to be from the 1.1.x (unstable)
				branch as <Studio/> is no longer supported in the 1.0.x branch.

		<sub name="installation">
			<header>Installation</header>
			<body>
				<ul>
					<li>You need <Exult/> and you need to install it properly 
						(see <extref doc="docs" target="installation"/>). Also make sure that
						you are using the latest snapshot of the 1.1.x branch of <Exult/>.</li>
					<li>For U*ix platforms you need to build <Studio/> from the source avillable from our 
						source snapshot at <extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php"/>.<br/>
						You will also need the GTK+ library installed as well as
				<extref target="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/libglade/libglade.html">libglade</extref>.<br/></li>
					<li>For Win32 platforms (Win9x,ME,2k,XP) you need to download 
						<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/snapshots/2.0/ExultStudio.exe"/>
						and install it in the same directory where you installed <Exult/>.</li>
				</ul>

		<sub name="studio_run">
			<header>Running <Studio/></header>
			<body>
				<para>
					You can run <Studio/> all by itself, but it isn't useful that way,
					as it uses <Exult/> as a server.  What you really want to do is:
				</para>
				<ul>
   				<li>Put 'exult_studio.glade' in the <Exult/> 'data' directory.</li>
   				<li>Be sure 'exult_studio' is in your path. (on Win32
   					'exult_studio.exe' needs to be in the same directory as exult.exe)</li>
				<li>On U*ix platforms you need to be running <Exult/> on X.</li>
   				<li>Run <Exult/> in windowed mode (not fullscreen).</li>
   				<li>Press 'alt-ctrl-m' to go into 'map-editor' mode.  If all is set
					up correctly, exult_studio will start up, and will have a list of files
					on the left side of its window (you need to have cheats enabled in <Exult/>,
					see the <extref doc="docs" target="gameplay_gump"/>).</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					Starting up one or the other separately will reconnect them:
				</para>
				<ul>
    			<li>If <Exult/> isn't running, start it up.  Then, in <Studio/>,
					use the 'File' menu to choose the static directory (for the game you're
					playing).</li>
   				<li>If <Studio/> isn't running start it up with:
        			exult_studio -x (path to dir containing exult_studio.glade) -d
        			(path to game directory)</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					You can also reconnect by selecting File-Connect in <Studio/>'s
					menus.

					<key>Ctrl-page</key> keys (z coordinates).</li>
					<li><strong>Paint</strong><br/>
					a single-left-click inserts the last-selected shape from 'shapes.vga', and dragging 
					with the left-button inserts that shape in every tile (so you'd probably only want 
					to do this with 8x8 flat shapes).  Also, in 'Paint' mode, the footprint at ground 
					level is shown (though this may be changed in the future).<br/>
					If you hold the alt key down, random frames from the currently-selected shape will 
					be painted (handy for grassy areas).</li>

				<para>
					Shapes are the basic graphical elements of the game. Each shape has one or more 
					frames that typically represent different states or angles of the same thing. 
					E.g. a button shape could have frames for pressed, and released; a character 
					could have frames depicting her sitting, standing up facing one way, or another, 
					swinging a punch, etc.<br/> 
					When a shape file is selected, the right part of the main window will show frame 
					zero of the shapes contained therein. Shapes can be selected by clicking, which 
					will show there number, number of frames, and name if known. Other frames can be 
					viewed by changing the frame number.
				</para>
				<para>
					When the selected file contains shapes that have names in their info you can also use
					the find option to find shapes that have that name (e.g. in shapes.vga you can search 
					for 'door' to find all shapes that have door frames). You can search down or up in the
					selected file.
				</para>

			<body>
				<para>
					Editing a game can become quite cumbersome when you have to choose between a lot
					of shape files containing several frames. To make this task easier we have 
					implemented so called groups to groups several shapes together. For example you can 
					group all shapes containing door frames together in a group called 'doors'.<br/>
					For this you have to select Groups and create a new group by writing the name in the 
					lower part of the window and then click 'add'. You now have the option in the Shape 
					Menu to add a shape to this group.<br/>
					When you doubleclick a group the group window opens that shows the shapes in the group 
					and by selecting a shape you see the shape info.
					You also have some options to edit the group:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Move</strong><br/>
						Moves the shapes within the group.</li>
					<li><strong>Remove</strong><br/>
						Removes the shape from the group.</li>
					<li><strong>Name</strong><br/>

					<li><strong>Frame:</strong><br/>						
						select the frame displayed.</li>
					<li><strong>Frames</strong><br/>						
						shows all the frames of a shape next to each others.</li>
					<li><strong>Find</strong><br/>						
						Lets you search for a specified shape in the group.</li>

				<para>
					With the latest source you can
				</para>
					<ul>
						<li>browse shapes in the main window.</li>
   						<li>drag a shape from the shape browser to <Exult/>, and that
							object will be placed in the game.</li>
   						<li>edit an 'egg' by double-clicking on it.  An edit box
							should appear.</li>
   						<li>create a new 'egg' using the pull-down menu in <Studio/>.
							In the Egg edit box, after you hit 'Apply', you'll be prompted to
							click in <Exult/> where you want the egg to appear.</li>
   						<li>If editing a 'monster' egg, you can set the monster by dragging
							the shape from the browser to the area that displays the monster.</li>
						<li>edit an NPC by double-clicking on it, and also create a new
							NPC using the pull-down menu.  Attributes, flags, and schedules can
							all be viewed and modified.</li>
						<li>can edit other objects' position and quality by double-clicking on them.</li>
						<li>browse the 'u7chunks' file, and drag them into <Exult/> to change
							the terrain.  In this browser, you can also create new terrains and
							modify their order.</li>
						<li>edit a 'terrain' (stored in 'u7chunks') by clicking the "Edit
							terrain" checkbox in <Studio/>.  This is a special mode where
							dragging with the left mouse button 'paints' the currently-selected
							shape (generally one of the flat tiles near the top of the shapes
							browser).  Note that a 'terrain' is generally used in multiple places
							in the mapand changing it in one place changes it in all the others as well.</li>
						<li>save the map using ExultStudio's "File-Save map" pulldown.
							In order to avoid writing over files inadvertantly, the files that
							would normally go into the 'static' directory, will, instead, go into
							a 'patch' directory that you specify in your 'exult.cfg' file.  Here's
							an example for editing BG:</li>

			<header>The shape editor</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					When you right click on a shape in the Shape browser (e.g. Files-Shapes.vga) you 
					get some options of how to edit the shapes.
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Add to group...</strong><br/>
						If you set up groups you can add shapes to them with this.</li>
					<li><strong>Info...</strong><br/>
						Displays the information of an object. You can change a lot of stuff there and 
						caution is adviced. The information is saved by 
						<ref1 target="file_menu">'Save all' or 'Save:Shape Info'</ref1>.</li>
					<li><strong>Edit...</strong>:<br/>
						Brings up your image-editor on the chosen frame.  When you save 
						in the image-editor, ES will read the changes back within 5 seconds.  This is 
						especially convenient if you have 'gimp-remote', as it will open a window for 
						the frame in an already-running gimp.</li>
					<li><strong>Edit tiled</strong>:<br/>
						This is only for 'flat' (8x8) shapes.  It forms an image 
						from all the frames and brings it up in the image-editor.  This is really 
						handy for making lots of terrain frames like grass.  A dialog lets you choose 
						the dimensions.</li>
					<li><strong>New frame</strong>:<br/>
						Creates a new frame after the currently-selected one.  The 'insert' key 
						also does this (and the 'del' key deletes a frame, though it's 
						buggy if there's just one frame left).</li>
					<li><strong>New shape</strong>:<br/>
						Gives you a dialog for choosing the shape #, as well as the 
						initial # of frames.<br/>
						You can also create a new font shape from TrueType or Type1 font files.
						It's mainly a convenience for someone creating a whole new game, as their
						only single-colored.  Maybe in the future we'll have some functions to
						create two-colored fonts like the main one in U7, although it might take

					Create 'combination shapes', like a fence or an entire roof by selecting

					time a file called combos.flx gets automatically created in the "Patch" directory.
					Choose the 'Pick for Combo' choice in the 'Modes' menu, and an empty window should 
					pop up. In the game window, double-click a group of objects, and they should appear 
					in the window. You can then select an object there and tweak its position. When you 
					are done hit aply and the combo gets temporally saved until you hit "Save all" or 
					"Save - Save map".<br/>

				</para>
				<para>
					For an example of how Usecode may look like download our experimental patch for BG at

					In that zip you'll find a readme.txt which tells you how to run it.<br/>
					You will also see two files called usecode.uc and usecode.
				</para>
				<para>
					Usecode.uc is the usecode script that will help you understand our usecode language.<br/>
					When you run ucc (see <ref target="tools"/>) with that file 
					(e.g. "ucc -o usecode usecode.uc") you will get the file called usecode. This file 
					'usecode' should be the same as the one in the zip file.

				<para>
					Someone does have to write extensive documentation for this but I (Dominus) am not

			<header>Other tools that might be useful</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					In the process of creating <Exult/> the team came up with some useful 
					tools that might help in editing/making a game.<br/>
					These can be built from the <Exult/> source or you can download
					the Windows binary snapshot. The source and binary snapshot can be found at
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php"/>.<br/>
					The tools are:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>expack</strong>:<br/>
						lets you extract and create Flex files. 
						See the 
						<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/expack.txt">manual</extref>.</li>
					<li><strong>ipack</strong>:<br/>
						a tool for creating and updating Exult and U7 image archives,  such as 'shapes.vga'. 
						See the 
						<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/ipack.txt">manual</extref>.</li>
					<li><strong>shp2pcx</strong>:<br/>
						converts all frames contained in a Shape file into PCX-format image files. 
						See the 
						<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/shp2pcx.txt">manual</extref>.</li>
					<li><strong>splitshp</strong>:<br/>
						can be used to combine frames of a Shape file into one file, or split a Shape 
						file into its component frames. 
						See the 
						<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/splitshp.txt">manual</extref>.</li>
					<li><strong>textpack</strong>:<br/>
						can be used edit text flex files. 
						See <extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/textpack.txt">manual</extref>.</li>
					<li><strong>ucc</strong>:<br/>
						can be used to create custom usecode (see <ref target="usecode_edit"/>).<br/>
						See the 
						<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/ucc.txt">manual</extref>.</li>
					<li><strong>The GIMP Plug-in</strong>:<br/>
						can be used for editing shapes in the GIMP. Handles multiframe Shape files. 
						See <extref target="http://www.gimp.org"/> for inormation on the GIMP.</li>
					<li><strong>Photoshop Plug-in</strong>:<br/>
						can be used for editing shapes in Photoshop. Can't handle multiframe Shape files. And

			<header>Porting <Studio/> to other platforms</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Currently <Studio/> runs on U*ix and Windows platforms. First it only
					ran on U*ix but with some effort by Colourless, Kirben and Mark Siewert
					it was succesfully ported to Win32.
				</para>
				<para>
					A port to other platforms depends on when someone volunteers to do the work :-)
					There are three issues:
				</para>
				<ul>
   				<li>GTK has to be ported to the platform.</li>
   				<li><Studio/> uses sockets to communicate with <Exult/>.</li>
   				<li>X drag-n-drop is used to put new objects on the landscape.  The
					'drop' part of this had to be rewritten for Win32 <Exult/>, OR,
					drag-n-drop could be an enhancement to SDL someday.<br/>
					As an alternative to dragging objects, you can now select a shape,
					then insert it into the game window by left-clicking while holding the
					Shift key down.</li>
				</ul>

		<sub name="client_server_stuff">
			<header>About this client/server stuff?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					A map-editor needs to provide the ability to display the game, place
					objects on the map, and move objects around.  That functionality is already in
					<Exult/>, and it makes sense to reuse it.  So we could have made <Exult/> a part of
					<Studio/>.  However, <Exult/> is already a huge program, and is getting
					unwieldy to work on.
				</para>
				<para>
					With this architecture, <Studio/> can have all the messy code for
					displaying/editing dialog boxes, while <Exult/> only needs a little bit
					of work to handle requests.
				</para>
				<para>
					Also, I (Jeff) wanted to get a little experience programming with
					sockets:-)

		<sub name="terrain_stuff">
			<header>About this 'terrain-editing' stuff and why you can't just
  					drag objects to where you want.</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					This confused me too, and I originally planned on doing away with it.
					But do a little arithmetic:  U7's world has 3072x3072 tiles; that's
					over 9 million that need to be set.  My guess is that they came up
					with the idea behind 'u7chunks' to save artists time and to give the
					map a consistent look.
				</para>
				<para>
					The basic idea is that each 'chunk' of flat terrain, 16x16 tiles, is
					stored in 'u7chunks', and is indexed by its position in this file (0,
					1, 2, ...). The 'u7map' file specifies, for each 'chunk' in the U7
					map, which of the terrains is to be used.  Since the entire map has
					192x192 chunks, or a total of 36,864, and since 'u7chunks' has 3072
					entries, each terrain is shared an average of over 10 times.  When you
					go into map-editing mode in Exult, the numbers displayed are the
					indices from 'u7chunks'.
				</para>
				<para>
					So here are the three sorts of scenery that you can see and edit:
				</para>
				<ol>
					<li>The 'terrain' (flat landscape, rocks, shrubs, and first-story
    					buildings) specified in 'u7chunks' and 'u7map'.</li>
    				<li>Other non-moveable objects (second-floor structures, trees) specified in
    					the 'ifixnn' files.</li>
    				<li>Moveable and changeable objects specified in the 'iregnn' files.</li>
				</ol>
				<para>
					The challenge of writing a map-editor is keeping the above straight,
					and reading/storing from/to the correct files.  It's sorta-kinda
					working now :-)
				</para>
				<para>
					For a more detailed explanation, see Gary Thompson's paper,
					'u7edit.txt' in our 'docs' directory.

					to figure out the problem.</li>
				<li>If you start <Studio/> from an SI game <Studio/> defaults to the BG data files.
					You have to change the game dir manually from the files menu.</li>

To build the FAQ you need Xalan (http://xml.apache.org/xalan-j/) and on that page see what else you need. Then you need to add xalan.jar and xerces.jar (from the Xalan package) to the system classpath.
Running "java org.apache.xalan.xslt.Process -IN exult_faq.xml -XSL faq_html.xsl -OUT faq.html" will build the file then.

To properly use the php files (docs.dat, faq.dat) you have to to strip the <?xml 
version="1.0"?> stuff, and also remove the <test xmlns="test.dtd"> 
... </test> stuff surrounding everything else

		<sub name="why_name_exult">
			<header>Why is it called <Exult/> - what is the meaning of this name?</header>
			<body>
				<cite name="Jeff wrote on the Boards">
					I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where
					the 'X' comes from. The "ult", of course, comes from Ultima. It
					was only about 6 months ago [02/29/2000] that I replaced the X code with SDL,
					which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to
					BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder
					to maintain that way.
				</cite>
				<cite name="Ibrahim Holtzmann">
					I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that
					means "to rejoice, to exhibit great happiness".

		<sub name="is_exult_free">
			<header>Is <Exult/> free ?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> is more than free: it's Free (notice the caps). <Exult/> is released
					under the GNU GPL (General Public License). This means that the source code
					for <Exult/> is freely available and you can do whatever you want with it.
					However, if you make modifications to any of <Exult/>'s components and publicly
					redistribute your work you are required to make the source freely available
					in turn. Obviously the <Exult/> team would be very grateful if any
					modifications you make are contributed back to the main code, so that
					everyone can benefit from them. If you want to work on <Exult/> just send an
					e-mail to the 
					<extref target="mailto:exult-general@lists.sourceforge.net">team</extref>.<br/>

		<sub name="origin_exult">
			<header>Does Origin support <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					First of all, Origin has been owned by EA for a long time now and from recent 
					developments it seems that Origin only exists now to maintain Ultima Online. 
					Furthermore, Origin and/or people that worked for Origin claim that the source 
					code for Ultima 7 (BG/SI) has been lost for some time.
					So there is no chance for the <Exult/> team to have a look at the actual code.
				</para>
				<para>
					Also the team tried to contact some people from Origin earlier but got no positive
					or negative response on the <Exult/> project. So far it seems that both Origin and 
					EA have decided to ignore <Exult/>.
				</para>
				<para>
					On the other hand former Origin employees contacted the team and congratulated the 
					team on their effort. Most noticeable are Lord British himself and Ken Demarest 
					(Programming Manager of Ultima 7)(hint:spell his name backwards).
				</para>
			</body>

		<sub name="other_ultimas">
			<header>Will <Exult/> support other Ultimas?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> supports only Ultima 7 (BG/SI and the add-ons). It will never support
					any other Ultima nor do members of the team plan to develop something similar.
					The reasons for this are that no other Ultima is similar to Ultima 7 in the 
					internal workings and also the team used to be quite sick of reverse engineering 
					a game already. 
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="pentagram">
			<header>But isn't <Pentagram/> some kind of <Exult/> for U8?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Pentagram/> is a pet project by some members of the <Exult/>team (currently mostly 
					Willem, Colourless, Fingolfin and Darke). It is a <strong>map and shapes viewer</strong> 
					and nothing more (although the team does indeed invest some time to disassemble the Usecode 
					of U8). It isn't meant to be something similar to <Exult/>. It is rather a clever plan
					to stir up interest in other coders to carry this basic work further.<br/>
					Any <strong>developer</strong> is welcome to take a look and contact us.
				</para>

		<sub name="multiplayer">
			<header>Will there be a multiplayer <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					No.
				</para>
				<cite name="Jeff on the Forum">
					The question is 'why?'. I continue working on <Exult/>, in large part, because 
					nobody makes games like Ultima7 anymore. While I think a multiplayer game 
					would be technically interesting, I don't see the need. There are <em>lots</em> 
					of them already, and many experienced people working on new ones.
				</cite>
				<para>
					Note however that <Exult/> is open source. If you want a multiplayer U7 no one
					holds you back to code it in.

		<sub name="whereis_exult">
			<header>Where do I find <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The latest official version is found on <extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/"/><br/>
					Daily snapshots (by Travis Howell) of the Win32 binary and of the CVS source tree can be found at
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php"/>.<br/>
					A BeOS binary snapshot can be found at 
					<extref target="http://digilander.iol.it/burton666/exult-beos.zip"/>. Jack Burton provides
					this weekly or whenever it compiles for him. Thanks!<br/>
					There is also a version available for AmigaOS/MorphOS at

		<sub name="whatis_snapshot">
			<header>What is a snapshot? Are these screenshots or what?</header>
			<body>
			    <para>
			    	Bugs and not yet implemented features in <Exult/> get fixed almost daily in the code.
			    	A release is very time consuming that's why there are so few.
			    </para>	
			    <para>
					The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It is updated almost
					daily, sometimes twice a day. There is information on how to build your
					own binary in the source but there is also the newest pre-compiled Windows executable.
					If you there is no new one this means that either there were no changes to the code
					or the source failed to compile.
				</para>
				<para>
					Also this FAQ mainly addresses the snapshots as people use them and ask question.
					And all the new features and improvements are found in those!
				</para>
			</body>

		<sub name="compile_snapshot">
			<header>How do I compile a source code snapshot for my OS?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The source code snapshots contain a file called "README.OS" (like Readme.win32, 
					Readme.MacOS) that explains everything.
				</para>

		<sub name="latest_version">
			<header>What is the latest version of <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The current official release is V0.96 Beta1. See also <ref target="whereis_exult"/>
					to learn where to get the latest version.

		<sub name="what_platforms">
			<header>On what platform does <Exult/> run?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> should be able to be compiled (with minor modifications) on
					any platform that SDL supports. Right now the source can be compiled
					in Linux/i386, Linux/Alpha, MacOS, OSX, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, BeOS and 
					Win32 (Windows 9x/ME/NT4/2000/XP).					
				</para>
				<para>
					Recently we discovered that there is also a working port of <Exult/> for
					MorphOS and AmigaOS. You can find that version at Ruediger Hanke's homepage
					<extref target="http://www.muenster.de/~tomjoad/exult.html"/>. We are currently
					working on integrating his changes into the main code and making those versions
					available on our homepage.

		<sub name="u7_versions">
			<header>Does <Exult/> work on all versions of the game?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					It seems to run most of the available versions of the game. The most common
					ones nowadays with the included Add-ons (Forge of Virtue and Silver Seed) 
					runs for sure.
				</para>
				<para>
					However there are reported problems with the localized versions of the
					game (French, German and Spanish). Conversation threads don't seem to skip to the
					next line in the proper places and therefore are unreadable in some cases. SI
					was published in English and Spanish (as we recently discovered to our surprise)
					but we seem to have fixed the main problem with the Spanish version.
				</para>
				<para>
					V0.91 Alpha2 adds fixes for the French version, which should work now.
					If you are running a Spanish or German version Black Gate and you notice 
					problems please contact us.

					You can play through the Black Gate/Forge of Virtue without cheating and
					plotholes.<br/>
					And since Beta1 the same is true for Serpent Isle/Silver Seed.
				</para>

		<sub name="si_support">
			<header>How about Serpent Isle?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Serpent Isle is now playable without cheating and plotholes. Two members of the team
					have already finished the game with <Exult/>. 
				</para>
				<para>
					Old quotes on this topic from the time when SI wasn't playable at all in <Exult/>.
				</para>
				<cite name="Colourless">
					I can't say much about the what will happen except that a completely
					working Serpent Isle will be an annoying task to complete. It is
					close to BG in some ways, but very different in others. 
				</cite>
				<cite name="Jeff">
					My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all
					the work so far on it. I'd much prefer to add enhancements to BG
					(which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG.
					Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals,
					that would change things. And also, since Exult is open-source,
					it would be fine if anyone wants to volunteer to work on SI.

			<header>Where do I find Ultima 7 on the net to download?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<em>Don't!</em> You may be able to find it on the net but it would be

		<sub name="si_ext_intro">
			<header>Will you implement the extended intro for SI?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The extended intro for Serpent Isle can be found at 
					<extref target="http://www.io.com/~dloubet/"/>. At this moment we don't
					even think about implementing this extended intro.<br/>
					Why not?<br/>
					It sure would be nice to use it. But you may have noticed some effects 
					missing from the intro. You may have noticed that there is no sound. You may 
					have noticed that there is neither speech nor subtitles.<br/>
					All that would have to be addressed and add to that the longer running time and 
					that you have to synchronize the music with it. Then what about the size of it? 
					You would need to compress it and make sure all our supported platforms make use 
					of it.
				</para>

					Everyone volunteering to do it is welcome to.

		<sub name="party_formation">
			<header>Why is the party formation different?</header>
			<body>				
				<para>
					In <Exult/> the party (the Avatar and his companions) move quite differently than
					they do in the original. This is actually not a bug but a disliking of the old
					style.
				</para>
				<cite name="Jeff">
					It's not a bug, it's a feature! I like it that way.  Everyone is sensitive to 
					different things, and I always though the formation-walking in the original 
					U7 looked really stupid. Eventually, someone may add the original type of walking 
					to Exult, probably as an option.
				</cite>

		<sub name="choppy_game">
			<header>Why does the game run so choppy?</header>
			<body>				
				<para>
					Well, every Ultima required a fast computer. Even though <Exult/> is just an
					engine that runs the ancient Ultima 7 it still requires a fast computer.
				</para>
				<para>
					Seriously, if the game runs choppy for you, try the speed seeting in the Gameoptions 
					menu and if that doesn't help also play with the original resolution (320x200),
					try a different scaler or disable scaling alltogether.

		<sub name="diferent_volume">
			<header>Why is the music so much louder/softer than the sfx/speech?</header>

		<sub name="virtue_stones">

		</sub>		
		<sub name="improvements">
			<header>
				What are the improvements in <Exult/> over the original Ultima 7?</header>
			<body>
				<ul>					
				<li>Many more keyboard shortcuts than the original had. Including in BG the 
					<key>k</key> key that checks if you have the right key for a lock in your 
					inventory. The list of keys can be found in the Documentation.</li>				
				<li>A new worked over Game menu. This menu is explained in detail in the 
					<extref target="docs.php">Documentation</extref> and many of the following 
					improvements  and Video/Audio options can be accessed via this menu. Open 
					this Game Menu by pressing <key>Esc</key> in the game.</li>
				<li>SI style paperdoll (inventory screen) in BG. Very impressive. For this you 
					need to have Serpent Isle installed on your hard drive and you must set the 
					path to it in exult.cfg (see the Documentation) and activate it in the 
					Gameplay Options<br/>
					This new inventory screen acts sometimes a little buggy, so if an item seems 
					to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Game Options.</li>
				<li>A beautiful new savegame box. This allows you much more savegames than 
					the original (you should run out of disc space before you run out of savegame 
					slots), shows a screenshot of the location you saved at, the members of your 
					party, your stats, game time and the date you actually saved. The save game 
					box is opened either via the game menu or the <key>s</key> key.</li>
				<li>Face status bars at the bottom of the screen that show your health (and that 
					of your party members) as well as your mana. Doubleclicking on the face opens 
					the inventory and doubleclicking on the bars shows the status screen.</li>
				<li>Middle mouse button support. In the normal game, the middle mouse button
					activates the target-function (which could also be accomplished by pressing
					't'). for modal gumps, the middle mouse acts as 'return', the right button
					as 'escape', so you can now for example accept the default slider value by
					just pressing the middle button. The escape function is also available
					during most other actions like selecting a target or conversations.</li>
				<li>Wheelmouse support. If you have a wheelmouse some features are auto-enabled 
					in <Exult/>.<br/> 
					In slider gumps (e.g. how much gold you want to 
					drop), scrolling the mouse up/down, moves the slider either left or right. 
					Holding down <key>Alt</key> while using the wheel scrolls 10 steps.<br/>
					The savegame menu scrolls one line, while pressing <key>Alt</key> it scrolls 
					pages.<br/>
					You can also scroll the map of the game up or down and while pressing 
					<key>Alt</key>  you scroll left or right.</li>
				<li>Fast Mouse which makes the mouse cursor move faster in fullscreen mode.</li>
				<li>Multiracial Avatar in BG. As with the paperdoll support you need to have SI 
					installed and the path set in exult.cfg.</li>
				<li>Higher resolutions than the original. You can set the resolution as high as 
					your computer supports. But there are some issues with it and it is considered
					cheating.</li>
				<li>Compressed savegames. Since Beta1 <Exult/> compresses savegames by default as
					zip files. They are still labeled *.sav and have the savegame name in the zip
					comment.</li>
				</ul>
			</body>

		<sub name="paperdoll_issues">
			<header>
				Are there issues with the SI style pardoll in BG?
			</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					There are some issues. The paperdoll in BG is still limited to the slots
					it had originally.
					That means:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>You can either equip a pair of gauntlets or one/two rings.</li>
					<li>The 'shield behind back', 'weapon behind back' and 'belt' slots are one 
					and the same in BG. (So if you have a weapon on your back, you can't use your 
					belt slot)</li>
					<li>If an item seems to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Game 
					Options, retrieve the item and enable the paperdolls again.</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					Sparks paperdoll looks very odd (Spark on steroids) as there is no paperdoll
					for kids in SI and we have to use the adult paperdoll. Unless someone draws
					heaps of art we can't do anything.

		<sub name="disable_improvements">
			<header>
				How do I disable all improvements?
			</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					To get an Ultima 7 that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible there
					are several things to do (though I wonder why you'd want to do that):
				</para>
				<ul>
				<li>make custom keybindings files (see <extref target="docs.php">Documentation</extref>) 
					in which you disable all the keys that were not in the original for Black Gate and 
					Serpents Isle.<br/> 
					Since the Alpha 4 release you have to assign <key>s</key> to old_file_gump
					to enable the old savegame menu (the line in your custom keybindings file should look 
					like: S old_file_gump)</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys.</li>
				<li>Disable SI-style paperdolls for BG in exult.cfg (see the documentation for that).</li>
				<li>Alternatively click on the disk icon and disable the paperdolls in the Gameplay 
					Options.</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and 
					disable scalers.</li>
				<li>The disc icon in the Avatar paperdoll opens the new game menu. As of now this cannot 
					be altered. Sorry!</li>

					Colourless, Kirben and Mark Siewert already did this for Win32. 
					There are three issues:
				</para>
				<ul>
   				<li>GTK has to be ported to the platform. This is already
					true for Win32.</li>
   				<li><Studio/> uses sockets to communicate with <Exult/>.  This also 
					shouldn't be a problem for Win32.</li>
   				<li>X drag-n-drop is used to put new objects on the landscape.  The
					'drop' part of this had to be rewritten for Win32 <Exult/>, OR,
					drag-n-drop could be an enhancement to SDL someday.<br/>
					As an alternative to dragging objects, you can now select a shape,
					then insert it into the game window by left-clicking while holding the
					Shift key down.</li>
				</ul>

		<sub name="how_to_run">
			<header>How do you run it?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					You can run <Studio/> all by itself, but it isn't useful that way,
					as it uses <Exult/> as a server.  What you really want to do is:
				</para>
				<ul>
   				<li>Put 'exult_studio.glade' in the <Exult/> 'data' directory.</li>
   				<li>Be sure 'exult_studio' is in your path. (on Win32 
   					'exult_studio.exe' needs to be in the same directory as exult.exe)</li>
   				<li>Run <Exult/> in windowed mode (not fullscreen).</li>
   				<li>Press 'alt-ctrl-m' to go into 'map-editor' mode.  If all is set
					up correctly, exult_studio will start up, and will have a list of files
					on the left side of its window (you need to have cheats enabled in <Exult/>,  
					see the <extref2 target="gameplay_gump"/>).</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					Starting up one or the other separately will reconnect them:
				</para>
				<ul>
    			<li>If <Exult/> isn't running, start it up.  Then, in <Studio/>,
					use the 'File' menu to choose the static directory (for the game you're
					playing).</li>
   				<li>If <Studio/> isn't running start it up with:
        			exult_studio -x (path to dir containing exult_studio.glade) -d 
        			(path to game directory)</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					You can also reconnect by selecting File-Connect in <Studio/>'s
					menus.
				</para>
			</body>

		<sub name="what_can_do_at_moment">
			<header>What can you do at the moment?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					With the latest source you can
				</para>				
				<ul>
				<li>browse shapes in the main window.</li>
   				<li>drag a shape from the shape browser to <Exult/>, and that
					object will be placed in the game.</li>
   				<li>edit an 'egg' by double-clicking on it.  An edit box
					should appear.</li>
   				<li>create a new 'egg' using the pull-down menu in <Studio/>.  
					In the Egg edit box, after you hit 'Apply', you'll be prompted to
					click in <Exult/> where you want the egg to appear.</li>
   				<li>If editing a 'monster' egg, you can set the monster by dragging
					the shape from the browser to the area that displays the monster.</li>					
				<li>edit an NPC by double-clicking on it, and also create a new
					NPC using the pull-down menu.  Attributes, flags, and schedules can
					all be viewed and modified.</li>					
				<li>can edit other objects' position and quality by double-clicking on them.</li>					
				<li>browse the 'u7chunks' file, and drag them into <Exult/> to change
					the terrain.  In this browser, you can also create new terrains and
					modify their order.</li>					
				<li>edit a 'terrain' (stored in 'u7chunks') by clicking the "Edit
					terrain" checkbox in <Studio/>.  This is a special mode where
					dragging with the left mouse button 'paints' the currently-selected
					shape (generally one of the flat tiles near the top of the shapes
					browser).  Note that a 'terrain' is generally used in multiple places
					in the map.</li>					
				<li>save the map using ExultStudio's "File-Save map" pulldown.
					In order to avoid writing over files inadvertantly, the files that
					would normally go into the 'static' directory, will, instead, go into
					a 'patch' directory that you specify in your 'exult.cfg' file.  Here's
					mine:</li>
				</ul>
				<configdesc>
					<line>&lt;game&gt;</line>
					<line>&lt;blackgate&gt;</line>
					<line>&lt;path&gt;</line>
					<line>./blackgate</line>
					<line>&lt;/path&gt;</line>
					<line>&lt;patch&gt;</line>
					<line>/home/jeff/exult/data/bg/static</line>
					<line>&lt;/patch&gt;</line>
					<line>&lt;title&gt;</line>
					<line>blackgate</line>
					<line>&lt;/title&gt;</line>
					<line>.</line>					
					<line>&lt;/blackgate&gt;</line>
				</configdesc>
				<para>
					<Exult/> will also read files from 'patch' if it exists.
				</para>
			</body>

		<sub name="what_next">
			<header>What's next?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The next things to be implemented are:
				</para>
				<ul>
    			<li>A 'barge' editor for creating things like ships and carts.</li>
   				<li>A 'flags' editor for viewing and editing the global Usecode flags by name.</li>
   				<li>A way to to create an entirely new game.  This is a fairly big issue,
					since it involves having <Exult/> run when many of its files don't yet
					exist.</li>
				<li>It will also be very nice to have a Usecode debugger someday as well.</li>
				</ul>

		<sub name="client_server_stuff">
			<header>What's with this client/server stuff?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					A map-editor needs to provide the ability to display the game, place
					objects on the map, and move objects around.  That functionality is already in
					<Exult/>, and it makes sense to reuse it.  So we could have made <Exult/> a part of
					<Studio/>.  However, <Exult/> is already a huge program, and is getting
					unwieldy to work on.
				</para>
				<para>  
					With this architecture, <Studio/> can have all the messy code for 
					displaying/editing dialog boxes, while <Exult/> only needs a little bit
					of work to handle requests.
				</para>
				<para>
					Also, I (Jeff) wanted to get a little experience programming with
					sockets:-)
				</para>
			</body>

		<sub name="terrain_stuff">
			<header>What's with this 'terrain-editing' stuff?  Why can't I just
  					drag objects to where I want?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					This confused me too, and I originally planned on doing away with it.
					But do a little arithmetic:  U7's world has 3072x3072 tiles; that's
					over 9 million that need to be set.  My guess is that they came up
					with the idea behind 'u7chunks' to save artists time and to give the
					map a consistent look.
				</para>
				<para>  
					The basic idea is that each 'chunk' of flat terrain, 16x16 tiles, is
					stored in 'u7chunks', and is indexed by its position in this file (0,
					1, 2, ....  The 'u7map' file specifies, for each 'chunk' in the U7
					map, which of the terrains is to be used.  Since the entire map has
					192x192 chunks, or a total of 36,864, and since 'u7chunks' has 3072
					entries, each terrain is shared an average of over 10 times.  When you
					go into map-editing mode in Exult, the numbers displayed are the
					indices from 'u7chunks'.
				</para>
				<para>
					So here are the three sorts of scenery that you can see and edit:
				</para>
				<ol>
					<li>The 'terrain' (flat landscape, rocks, shrubs, and first-story
    					buildings) specified in 'u7chunks' and 'u7map'.</li>
    				<li>Other non-moveable objects (second-floor structures, trees) specified in
    					the 'ifixnn' files.</li>
    				<li>Moveable and changeable objects specified in the 'iregnn' files.</li>
				</ol>
				<para>
					The challenge of writing a map-editor is keeping the above straight,
					and reading/storing from/to the correct files.  It's sorta-kinda
					working now :-) 
				</para>
				<para>
					For a more detailed explanation, see Gary Thompson's paper,
					'u7edit.txt' in our 'docs' directory.

			<header>How do I submit a proper bug report?</header>
			<body>
				<ol>
				<li>Read the <extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/docs.php">Documentation</extref>
					and this FAQ to see if that is not already covered and you have all set up correctly.</li>
				<li>Before you report a bug to the 
					<extref target="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2335">bug tracker</extref> 
					please try the latest 
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php">snapshot</extref>.
					If the bug still occurs make sure that no one else already reported the bug 
					(in the bug tracker).</li>
				<li>If you are not a Sourceforge member please include your e-mail address. This is 
					important so we can get back to you. If you are a Sourceforge member please log in 
					before submitting a bug. If you are a member of Sourceforge you will also get notified
					of follow ups on your bug automatically by E-mail.</li>
				<li>Make sense in the topic! For example, if the problem is with Rowenna in Skara Brae 
					don't just choose "Skara Brae" in the topic. "BG: Rowenna crashes game" makes more 
					sense. Sadly the space for the topics is limited. Explain the topic in "Detailed 
					Description".</li>
				<li>Include information on what version of <Exult/> you are using. You should have used 
					the latest snapshot but please tell us the date of the snapshot.</li>
				<li>State which Operating System you use (Windows 9X, Linux, ...).</li>
				<li>Please include a savegame (use common sense if it is really needed). You will find 
					those in the game directories you put in the exult.cfg. They are called exult**bg.sav 
					(** is a number) for BG and exult**si.sav for SI. You can look up the filename int the
					savegame dialog as well (to the right, above the party members). As some parts of the game 
					may require you to complete other quests or stuff before you get to the bug you want to 
					report it's much easier for the team to look at the problem (speeds the process up a bit 
					as they are much more likely you take a look at the problem this way).<br/>
					<strong>You need to check the box saying "Check to upload and Attach file".</strong>. 
					See this screenshot for an example:
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/images/sfbug.jpg"/></li>
				<li><em>One</em> bug per subject please.</li>			
				</ol>
				<para>
					<strong>Note</strong> that SourceForge requires users to enable cookies to attach files.
					If you use Internet Explorer 6.0 your Cookies Security needs to be at medium or below.

				<para>
					You can also use our 
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/forum/">forum</extref> 
					to report bugs. But if you do please follow the guidelines mentioned above (you can't
					include a savegame of course). Though be aware that bugs submitted to the bug tracker

		<sub name="by_design">
			<header>Broken by Design</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> often behaves and works differently than the original Ultima 7. These
					behaviors are sometimes features that just differ from the way the original 
					worked.<br/> 
					Some are bugs that the development team consider to have almost no detrimental 
					effect to the enjoyment/running of the game, but would require a large amount 
					of time and effort to fix.<br/>
					Please don't bother the team about those as some of these will be fixed in the 
					future, others will only be fixed when someone who thinks it should be done 
					differently sits down and codes it.<br/>
					The following are such 'features' of Exult:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>Birds and animals open doors and such, like the human and sentient 
						creatures of Britannia do.</li>
					<li>Party members don't walk lockstep with the Avatar like they do in 
						BG/SI. Please see <ref1 target="party_formation"/>.</li>
					<li>The way the Avatar and the companions walk. Is it 2 frames or 3 frames?
						This has been changed a lot as this is disputed almost every four weeks.
						Currently <Exult/> is coded using 2 frames.</li>
					<li>Combat works differently. We don't have any hard data or formulae 
						that tell us how combat worked in BG/SI, so DrCode put something 
						together. If you have any information you've worked out related to 
						this, please tell either the forum or the exult-general mailing list.<br/>
						Recently Jeff added an option to change the combat difficulty in exult.cfg.
						See the <extref2 target="exult_config"/>.</li>
					<li>Negative health and unconsciousness. Yes, it may look weird to have 
						people walking around with negative health, but that's the way it 
						currently works.</li>
					<li>Some music loops endlessly in <Exult/>. This is actually a correction of a bug
						in the original. We respects the midi looping flag as set by U7's original data 
						files but the original didn't. Users who prefer the original (broken) are able
						to choose so in the Game menu.</li> 
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Stealing and killing innocent NPCs doesn't work yet like it does in the original</li>
					<li>Movement is sometimes jerky or slow.</li>
					<li>We don't know what all the data in 'weapons.dat' and 'ammo.dat'
						means, so hit points and damage don't work as well as in the original
						game.</li>
					<li>If you run a resolution higher than the original (320x200) some NPCs
						that are further away from the Avatar may seem to disappear and reappear when
						you get away or closer to them.</li>
					<li>With scalers enabled you might encounter slow downs of the game. The team is
						working on this right now and it is already a lot faster.</li>
					<li>The speech in the intro is out of synch with the lips animation. But now it 
						matches the speed of the text.</li>
					<li>There are reported problems with digital sound effects or speech when 
						using Vortex series sound cards (like the Diamond MX 300) under Win9x/ME. <Exult/>
						is triggering a bug in the drivers.</li>
					<li>There is also a problem involving Win9x/ME, C-Media soundcard chipsets and MIDI music.
						We suggest you first upgrade your drivers to the newest ones. Get them at 
						<extref target="http://www.cmedia.com.tw/"/>. If that doesn't help, please contact
						us.</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					Possible <strong>workaround</strong> for the above mentioned audio issues:<br/>
					We added a config file option for Windows "config/audio/force_waveout" 
					that when set to "yes" will force SDL to use waveout rather than attempting to use
					DirectSound. Using this option may fix problems some people have with sound in
	  				Exult under Windows. Additionally it seems to fix the popping sound when starting 
	  				Exult in Win9x/ME/2k.<br/>
	  				This setting is now the default setting so downloading the latest snapshot is the 
	  				only thing you need to do.

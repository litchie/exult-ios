				<cite name="Jeff wrote on the Boards">
					I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where
					the 'X' comes from. The "ult", of course, comes from Ultima. It
					was only about 6 months ago [02/29/2000] that I replaced the X code with SDL,
					which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to
					BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder
					to maintain that way.

					I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that

			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> is more than free: it's Free (notice the caps). <Exult/> is released
					under the GNU GPL (General Public License). This means that the source code
					for <Exult/> is freely available and you can do whatever you want with it.
					However, if you make modifications to any of <Exult/>s components and publicly
					redistribute your work you are required to make the source freely available
					in turn. Obviously the <Exult/> team would be very grateful if any
					modifications you make are contributed back to the main code, so that
					everyone can benefit from them. If you want to work on <Exult/> please contact

		<sub name="exult_donation">
			<header>Do you accept donations?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					No, the <Exult/> team will not accept donations. For us there are greater legal matters 
					involved, which none of us particularly want to explore. We do not want to risk the 
					wrath of EA for directly profiting off <Exult/>.<br/>
					If you want to donate to anyone, donate to

		<sub name="origin_exult">
			<header>Does Origin support <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					First of all, Origin has been owned by EA for a long time now and from recent
					developments it seems that Origin only exists now to maintain Ultima Online.
					Furthermore, Origin and/or people that worked for Origin claim that the source
					code for Ultima 7 (BG/SI) has been lost for some time.
					So there is no chance for the <Exult/> team to have a look at the actual code.
				</para>
				<para>
					Also the team tried to contact some people from Origin earlier but got no positive
					or negative response on the <Exult/> project. So far it seems that both Origin and
					EA have decided to ignore <Exult/>.
				</para>
				<para>
					On the other hand former Origin employees contacted the team and congratulated the
					team on their effort. Most noticeable are Lord British himself and Ken Demarest
					(Programming Manager of Ultima 7)(hint:spell his name backwards).

		<sub name="other_ultimas">
			<header>Will <Exult/> support other Ultima games?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> supports only Ultima 7 (BG/SI and the add-ons). It will never support
					any other Ultima nor do members of the team plan to develop something similar.
					The reasons for this are that no other Ultima is similar to Ultima 7 in the
					internal workings and also the team used to be quite sick of reverse engineering
					a game already.

		<sub name="pentagram">
			<header>But isn't <Pentagram/> some kind of <Exult/> for U8?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Pentagram/> is a pet project by some members of the <Exult/> team (currently mostly
					Willem, Colourless, Fingolfin and Darke). It is a <strong>map and shapes viewer</strong>
					and nothing more (although the team does indeed invest some time to disassemble the Usecode
					of U8). It isn't meant to be something similar to <Exult/>. It is rather a clever plan
					to stir up interest in other coders to carry this basic work further.<br/>
					Any <strong>developer</strong> is welcome to take a look and contact us.
				</para>
				<para>
					Seriously <Pentagram/> is slowly progressing and you can find snapshots of the code and
					Win32 binaries for it on the <Pentagram/>

				<para>
					No.
				</para>
				<cite name="Jeff on the Forum">
					The question is 'why?'. I continue working on <Exult/>, in large part, because
					nobody makes games like Ultima7 anymore. While I think a multiplayer game
					would be technically interesting, I don't see the need. There are <em>lots</em>

			    </para>
			    <para>
					The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It is updated almost
					daily, sometimes twice a day. There is information on how to build your
					own binary in the source but there is also the newest pre-compiled Windows executable.
					If there is no new one this means that either there were no changes to the code

				<para>
					<Exult/> should be able to be compiled (with minor modifications) on

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Android, Java</strong><br/>
					Jeff, Dr.Code, is currently porting <Exult/> to Android by rewriting it in Java. If 
					you want to follow the progress of the port take a look at our 
					<extref target="http://goo.gl/VJCNG">forum</extref>.</li>
					
					<li><strong>Android, native</strong><br/>
					KenC ported <Exult/> directly to Android, without rewriting it in Java. He has 
					posted about it in our
					<extref target="http://goo.gl/E2y7Z">forum</extref>.</li>
					
					<li><strong>Zaurus</strong><br/>
					Artaxerxes developed the port to
					<extref target="http://www.myzaurus.com/">Zaurus</extref>, a Linux/ARM based PDA.
					It is already fully playable (Artaxerxes played through SI). Pictures of the Zaurus
					running SI can be found at
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/images/screenshots/zaurus/"/> and an
					IPK package at <extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php"/>.</li>
					
					<li><strong>Amiga/MorphOS</strong><br/>
					Ruediger Hanke's ported <Exult/> to MorphOS and AmigaOS. Unfortunately the port has 
					been abandoned for quite some time now. But you can only find the archived homepage 
					for this port at 
					<extref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20070927190600/http://www.muenster.de/~tomjoad/exult.html"/>.
					Unfortunately the download is no longer available.</li>

					<Exult/> has been ported to Dingoo (see 
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/forum/">our forum</extref> and 
					<extref target="http://crankgaming.blogspot.com/2010/09/exult-v14svn6317-for-dingux-beta2.html">this Announcement</extref>)

		<sub name="any_port">
			<header>Will there be a port of <Exult/> for &lt;insert platform here&gt;?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					That depends on a great many things. For one, it requires a developer that (1) has the 
					necessary free time, (2) the necessary knowledge about programming for the platform in 
					question, (3) the necessary motivation to do the port and (4) access to the platform in 
					question. Any of the <Exult/> developers may lack one or more of the items above, but it 
					will probably the fourth (and, by consequence, the third) item. This is likely fatal 
					for the port: programming using an emulator (if one is even available) may result in a 
					port that works on the emulator but not on the original (unless the emulator is that 
					good), and programming without any access at all to the platform in question is a 
					pointless and frustrating exercise in futility.
				</para>
				<para>
					Moreover, some platforms might require U7 and/or SI to come bundled with <Exult/>; that alone 
					would disqualify any official builds for legal reasons.

					In the past there were reported problems with the localized versions of the

					My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all

					(which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG.
					Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals,

					However it is not advisable to use savegames of games started with the 1.4.9 RC1

		<sub name="party_formation">
			<header>Why is the party formation different?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					In <Exult/> the party (the Avatar and his companions) move quite differently than
					they do in the original. The problem is that this was controlled by the original
					executable. Changing the formation now is not as easy as it sounds as the party
					formation has effects on other game internals. Changing it to be more like the
					original may force us to replay the whole game to make sure we didn't introduce
					new bugs.
				</para>
				<para>
					Some time ago Jeff added an optional formation that behaves way more like in the
					original game and it has become the default formation now.<br/>
					This can be changed in the <extref doc="docs" target="exult_config">exult.cfg</extref>.
				</para>
				<cite name="Jeff">
					It's not a bug, it's a feature! I like it that way.  Everyone is sensitive to
					different things, and I always though the formation-walking in the original

					to <Exult/>, probably as an option.

		<sub name="save_crash">
			<header>What should I do when Exult keeps crashing when I try to save?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					This is <strong>not</strong> normal behavior for <Exult/>. Normally when you restart
					and "Journey Onward" <Exult/> will actually restore to the point you saved.
				</para>
				<para>
					<em>Please do not play further</em> at this point. You should restore to an earlier
					save game, no matter how much game time you loose. Your game must have gotten
					corrupted and when you play on with it you will most likely experience even more
					serious problems.
				</para>
				<para>
					Please also avoid saving when a scripted sequence is running. Whenever you can't control
					the Avatar on your own a scripted scene is running and saving at this time will break the
					game on reloading.

		<sub name="choppy_game">
			<header>Why does the game run so choppy?</header>

				<para>
					Well, every Ultima required a fast computer. Even though <Exult/> is just an
					engine that runs the ancient Ultima 7 it still requires a fast computer.
				</para>
				<para>
					Seriously, if the game runs choppy for you, try the speed setting in the Game Options
					menu and if that doesn't help also play with the original resolution (320x200),
					try a different scaler or disable scaling altogether.

			<header>Why does my monitor stay black when I try to run <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The most common reason for this is that you try to run <Exult/> full screen in a
					resolution that isn't supported by either your monitor or your graphics card.
					Edit your exult.cfg (see <extref doc="docs" target="exult_config"/>) to disable
					full screen. If <Exult/> now runs fine in a window you have to select a different
					resolution (also editable in exult.cfg) to run it full screen.<br/>
					If it still doesn't run contact us.

		<sub name="improvements">
			<header>
				What are the improvements in <Exult/> over the original Ultima 7?</header>
			<body>
				<ul>
				<li>Many more keyboard shortcuts than the original had. Including in BG the
					<key>k</key> key that checks if you have the right key for a lock in your
					inventory. The list of keys can be found in the Documentation.</li>
				<li>A new worked over Game Options menu. This menu is explained in detail in the
					<extref target="docs.php">Documentation</extref> and many of the following
					improvements  and Video/Audio options can be accessed via this menu. Open
					this Game Options Menu by pressing <key>Esc</key> in the game.</li>
				<li>SI style paperdoll (inventory screen) in BG. Very impressive. For this you
					need to have Serpent Isle installed on your hard drive and you must set the
					path to it in exult.cfg (see the Documentation) and activate it in the
					Gameplay Options.<br/>
					This new inventory screen acts sometimes a little buggy, so if an item seems
					to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Gameplay Options.</li>
				<li>A beautiful new save game box. This allows you much more save games than
					the original (you should run out of disc space before you run out of save game
					slots), shows a screenshot of the location you saved at, the members of your
					party, your stats, game time and the date you actually saved. The save game
					box is opened either via the game menu or the <key>s</key> key.</li>
				<li>Face status bars at the bottom of the screen that show your health (and that
					of your party members) as well as your mana. Double-clicking on the face opens
					the inventory and double-clicking on the bars shows the status screen.</li>
				<li>Middle mouse button support. In the normal game, the middle mouse button
					activates the target-function (which could also be accomplished by pressing
					't'). for modal gumps, the middle mouse acts as 'return', the right button
					as 'escape', so you can now for example accept the default slider value by
					just pressing the middle button. The escape function is also available
					during most other actions like selecting a target or conversations.</li>
				<li>Wheel mouse support. If you have a wheel mouse some features are auto-enabled
					in <Exult/>.<br/>
					In slider gumps (e.g. how much gold you want to
					drop), scrolling the mouse up/down, moves the slider either left or right.
					Holding down <key>Alt</key> while using the wheel scrolls 10 steps.<br/>
					The save game menu scrolls one line, while pressing <key>Alt</key> it scrolls
					pages.<br/>
					You can also scroll the map of the game up or down and while pressing
					<key>Alt</key>  you scroll left or right.</li>
				<li>Fast Mouse which makes the mouse cursor move faster in full screen mode.</li>
				<li>Multiracial Avatar in BG. As with the paperdoll support you need to have SI
					installed and the path set in exult.cfg.</li>
				<li>Higher resolutions than the original. You can set the resolution as high as
					your computer supports. But there are some issues with it and it is considered
					cheating.</li>
				<li>Compressed save games. <Exult/> compresses save games by default as
					zip files. They are still labeled *.sav and have the save game name in the zip
					comment.</li>
				<li>A notebook for making notes and the possibility to automatically add notes</li>
				</ul>

		<sub name="paperdoll_issues">

				Are there issues with the SI style paperdoll in BG?
			</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					There are some issues. The paperdoll in BG is still limited to the slots
					it had originally.<br/>
					That means:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>You can either equip a pair of gauntlets or one/two rings.</li>
					<li>The 'shield behind back', 'weapon behind back' and 'belt' slots are one
					and the same in BG. (So if you have a weapon on your back, you can't use your
					belt slot)</li>
					<li>If an item seems to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Game
					Options, retrieve the item and enable the paperdolls again.</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					Sparks paperdoll looks very odd (Spark on steroids) as there is no paperdoll
					for kids in SI and we have to use the adult paperdoll. Unless someone draws
					heaps of art we can't do anything.

				<para>
					To get an Ultima 7 that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible there
					are several things to do (though I wonder why you'd want to do that):
				</para>
				<ul>
				<li>make custom key bindings files (see <extref target="docs.php">Documentation</extref>)
					in which you disable all the keys that were not in the original for Black Gate and
					Serpents Isle.<br/>
					To enable the old save game menu you have to assign <key>s</key> to old_file_gump
					(the line in your custom key bindings file should look like: S old_file_gump)</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys.</li>
				<li>Disable SI-style paperdolls for BG in exult.cfg (see the documentation for that).</li>
				<li>Alternatively click on the disk icon and disable the paperdolls in the Gameplay Options.</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and
					disable scalers.</li>
				<li>The disc icon in the Avatar paperdoll opens the new game menu. As of now this cannot
					be altered. Sorry!</li>

			<header>How do I submit a proper bug report?</header>
			<body>
				<ol>
				<li>Read the <extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/docs.php">Documentation</extref>
					and this FAQ to see if that is not already covered and you have all set up correctly.</li>
				<li>Before you report a bug to the
					<extref target="sourceforge.net/p/exult/bugs">bug tracker</extref>
					please try the latest
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php">snapshot</extref>.
					If the bug still occurs make sure that no one else already reported the bug
					(in the bug tracker).</li>
				<li>Right now you can only submit a bug report in our tracker if you are a SourceForge member.
					We are sorry for this slight inconvenience (signing up on SourceForge is free and easy) but 
					the bug tracker had been plagued by spam attacks and valid bugs were pushed further down.
					The upside of this is that if we have questions or fix this bug you will get automatically 
					notified by eMail.</li>
				<li>Make sense in the topic! For example, if the problem is with Rowenna in Skara Brae
					don't just choose "Skara Brae" in the topic. "BG: Rowenna crashes game" makes more
					sense. Sadly the space for the topics is limited.</li>
				<li>Include information on what version of <Exult/> you are using. You should have used
					the latest snapshot but please tell us the date of the snapshot.</li>
				<li>State which Operating System you use (Windows 7, Linux, OS X 10.9,...).</li>
				<li>Please include a save game (use common sense if it is really needed). You will find
					those in the game directories you put in the exult.cfg. They are called exult**bg.sav
					(** is a number) for BG and exult**si.sav for SI. You can look up the filename in the
					save game dialog as well (to the right, above the party members). As some parts of the game
					may require you to complete other quests or stuff before you get to the bug you want to
					report it's much easier for the team to look at the problem (speeds the process up a bit
					as they are much more likely you take a look at the problem this way).</li>
				<li>You may be asked to provide the log files of <Exult/>. These are named stdout.txt and 
					stderr.txt and can be found where exult.cfg is saved to, see 
					<ref1 target="where_cfg"/>.</li>
				<li>You may be asked to provide the log files of <Studio/>. These are named studio_out.txt and 
				studio_err.txt and can be found where exult.cfg is saved to, see 
				<ref1 target="where_cfg"/>.</li>
				<li><em>One</em> bug per subject please.</li>
				</ol>
				<para>
					Any bug report that requires a save game will most likely be
					<strong>tagged invalid</strong> if we don't receive a save game after we requested it.
				</para>
				<para>
					You can also use our
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/forum/">forum</extref>
					to report bugs. But if you do please follow the guidelines mentioned above (you can't
					include a save game of course). Though be aware that bugs submitted to the bug tracker
					are more likely to get attention than bugs submitted to the forum.<br/>
					And if you report to the forum, also follow the "one bug per report" rule, a post with 
					many bug reports in it is likely to have some bugs overlooked in the end.

			<header>Broken by Design</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> often behaves and works differently than the original Ultima 7. These
					behaviors are sometimes features that just differ from the way the original
					worked.<br/>
					Some are bugs that the development team consider to have almost no detrimental
					effect to the enjoyment/running of the game, but would require a large amount
					of time and effort to fix.<br/>
					Please don't bother the team about those as some of these will be fixed in the
					future, others will only be fixed when someone who thinks it should be done
					differently sits down and codes it.<br/>
					The following are such 'features' of <Exult/>:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>Birds and animals open doors and such, like the human and sentient
						creatures of Britannia do. You should rarely encounter this anymore 
						since there are better intelligence checks, but it can still happen.</li>
					<li>The way the Avatar and the companions walk. Is it 2 frames or 3 frames?
						This has been changed a lot as this was disputed almost every four weeks.
						Finally it works like the original and the Avatar uses two frames and the
						companions use three frames.</li>
					<li>Some music loops endlessly in <Exult/>. This is actually a correction of a bug
						in the original. We respects the midi looping flag as set by U7's original data
						files but the original didn't. Users who prefer the original (broken) are able
						to choose so in the Game menu.</li>

					<li>Stealing and killing innocent NPCs doesn't work yet like it does in the original.</li>
					<li>Movement is sometimes jerky or slow.</li>
					<li>If you run a resolution higher than the original (320x200) some NPCs
						that are further away from the Avatar may seem to disappear and reappear when
						you get away or closer to them.</li>
					<li>With scalers enabled you might encounter slow downs of the game.</li>
					<li>Nvidia 40.x reference drivers have issues with all SDL based programs. Use either a

				<ul>
					<li>There is a bug/incompatibility with the flex bundled Linux distributions

					<li>In some versions of Ubuntu (and probably some other distributions), you have to 
						add some X11 libraries or <Exult/> won't link (for example, by adding "AC_PATH_XTRA" 
						to configure.ac). Since the Ubuntu version "Jaunty Jackalope" that fix isn't needed 
						anymore, though.</li>
					<li>After compiling, remember to copy the exult*.flx files from the data folder in

			<header>Where did XY disappear to (SI)?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					SI is very plot driven, so to stop people from breaking the plot, certain NPCs
					stay in a unaccessible spot on the map until you meet them by following the plot,
					or disappear from the map until they are needed again. If you cheat by 
					teleporting to them before the scripted meeting you are bound to break the plot 
					and most likely forced to reload an earlier savegame or start the whole game again.<br/>
					So please take care when teleporting around the map.

			<header>Why can't I find Karnax and the other monks (SI)?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					See the above question. You have to use the Dark Path to make the monks appear 
					on Monk Island. If you just use the teleport cheat they won't show up.

		<sub name="serpent_staff">
			<header>An important note about the Serpent Staff (SI)</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The Serpent Staff in SI is a very important item. It doesn't seem like it but
					it is crucial to some major plot elements that you have the staff in your
					possession.<br/>
					Unfortunately the game also demands that you get the staff properly. For that I
					recommend to get it without cheating and to stand right next to it.
				</para>
				<para>
					Just picking it up and not transferring it to the inventory at once, but instead 
					putting it on the ground again could break later plot. Willem coded a workaround
					in <Exult/> so the problem might disappear.
				</para>

		<sub name="pillars_fort">
			<header>How to break the plot by double clicking some pillars (SI-SS)</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					In the dining hall of the fort in the add-on Silver Seed you can double click the
					pillars. This teleports you to the test in the gargoyle city. If you haven't done
					this test yet this breaks that plot later on and if you already have it is still a
					nuisance. So better don't do it.
				</para>
				<para>
					Obviously a slight oversight of the add-on designers. Could be fixed by changing the
					usecode and the map slightly.

		<sub name="altar_discipline">
			<header>Left or right on the Altar of Discipline (SI-SS)</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					In the Temple of Discipline you need to place a quartz and obsidian symbol 
					(Y-shape) onto the altar to disable the trap and to call a bridge into being.<br/>
					The book "The Symbol of Discipline" you find in the upper floor sates:
				</para>
				<cite name="The Symbol of Discipline by Sharless">
					The altar before the serpent statue doth have upon it two slots ... 
					bolts of lightning fire from the altar unless the quartz symbol is placed 
					in the slot on the left side. A bridge ... is called into being if the obsidian 
					symbol is placed in the right slot...
				</cite>
				<para>
					This is highly confusing as the player looks at the screen and associates west 
					in the game with left and east with right. Whoever wrote this originally must 
					have imagined the Avatar standing to the north of the altar and facing the temple 
					entrance.<br/>
					So you need to place the quartz symbol onto the east depression of the altar and 
					the obsidian symbol onto the west depression.

			<header>Why is it called <Exult/> - what is the meaning of this name?</header>
			<body>
				<cite name="Jeff wrote on the Boards">
					I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where
					the 'X' comes from. The "ult", of course, comes from Ultima. It
					was only about 6 months ago [02/29/2000] that I replaced the X code with SDL,
					which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to
					BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder
					to maintain that way.
				</cite>
				<cite name="Ibrahim Holtzmann">
					I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that
					means "to rejoice, to exhibit great happiness".

		<sub name="is_exult_free">
			<header>Is <Exult/> free ?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> is more than free: it's Free (notice the caps). <Exult/> is released
					under the GNU GPL (General Public License). This means that the source code
					for <Exult/> is freely available and you can do whatever you want with it.
					However, if you make modifications to any of <Exult/>s components and publicly
					redistribute your work you are required to make the source freely available
					in turn. Obviously the <Exult/> team would be very grateful if any
					modifications you make are contributed back to the main code, so that
					everyone can benefit from them. If you want to work on <Exult/> please contact 
					us via our
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/forum/post.php?f=1">forum</extref>.<br/>
 					More information on the GNU GPL at

		<sub name="exult_donation">
			<header>Do you accept donations?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					No, the <Exult/> team will not accept donations. For us there are greater legal matters 
					involved, which none of us particularly want to explore. We do not want to risk the 
					wrath of EA for directly profiting off <Exult/>.<br/>
					If you want to donate to anyone, donate to 
					<extref target="http://sourceforge.net/donate/">Sourceforge</extref>. 
					We wouldn't be here if it weren't for them. 
				</para>

		<sub name="origin_exult">
			<header>Does Origin support <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					First of all, Origin has been owned by EA for a long time now and from recent
					developments it seems that Origin only exists now to maintain Ultima Online.
					Furthermore, Origin and/or people that worked for Origin claim that the source
					code for Ultima 7 (BG/SI) has been lost for some time.
					So there is no chance for the <Exult/> team to have a look at the actual code.
				</para>
				<para>
					Also the team tried to contact some people from Origin earlier but got no positive
					or negative response on the <Exult/> project. So far it seems that both Origin and
					EA have decided to ignore <Exult/>.
				</para>
				<para>
					On the other hand former Origin employees contacted the team and congratulated the
					team on their effort. Most noticeable are Lord British himself and Ken Demarest
					(Programming Manager of Ultima 7)(hint:spell his name backwards).
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="other_ultimas">
			<header>Will <Exult/> support other Ultima games?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> supports only Ultima 7 (BG/SI and the add-ons). It will never support
					any other Ultima nor do members of the team plan to develop something similar.
					The reasons for this are that no other Ultima is similar to Ultima 7 in the
					internal workings and also the team used to be quite sick of reverse engineering
					a game already.
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="pentagram">
			<header>But isn't <Pentagram/> some kind of <Exult/> for U8?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Pentagram/> is a pet project by some members of the <Exult/> team (currently mostly
					Willem, Colourless, Fingolfin and Darke). It is a <strong>map and shapes viewer</strong>
					and nothing more (although the team does indeed invest some time to disassemble the Usecode
					of U8). It isn't meant to be something similar to <Exult/>. It is rather a clever plan
					to stir up interest in other coders to carry this basic work further.<br/>
					Any <strong>developer</strong> is welcome to take a look and contact us.
				</para>
				<para>
					Seriously <Pentagram/> is slowly progressing and you can find snapshots of the code and
					Win32 binaries for it on the <Pentagram/>
					<extref target="http://pentagram.sourceforge.net/snapshots/"> snapshots page</extref>.
				</para>
				<para>
					On the official <Pentagram/> homepage at <extref target="http://pentagram.sourceforge.net/"/>
					you will find more information on this project.

		<sub name="multiplayer">
			<header>Will there be a multiplayer <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					No.
				</para>
				<cite name="Jeff on the Forum">
					The question is 'why?'. I continue working on <Exult/>, in large part, because
					nobody makes games like Ultima7 anymore. While I think a multiplayer game
					would be technically interesting, I don't see the need. There are <em>lots</em>
					of them already, and many experienced people working on new ones.
				</cite>
				<para>
					Note however that <Exult/> is open source. If you want a multiplayer U7 no one
					holds you back to code it in.

		<sub name="whereis_exult">
			<header>Where do I find <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The latest official version is found on
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/"/><br/>
					Daily snapshots (by Travis Howell) of the Win32 binary and of the SVN source tree
					can be found at
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php"/>.<br/>
					Lanica Dragon also provides very infrequent snapshots for the PocketPC port at 
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php"/>.<br/>
					Dominus provides snapshots for OS X 10.4 and upwards whenever he manages to at
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php"/>.

		<sub name="whatis_snapshot">
			<header>What is a snapshot? Are these screenshots or what?</header>
			<body>
			    <para>
			    	Bugs and not yet implemented features in <Exult/> get fixed almost daily in the code.
			    	A release is very time consuming that's why there are so few.
			    </para>
			    <para>
					The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It is updated almost
					daily, sometimes twice a day. There is information on how to build your
					own binary in the source but there is also the newest pre-compiled Windows executable.
					If there is no new one this means that either there were no changes to the code
					or the source failed to compile.
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="compile_snapshot">
			<header>How do I compile a source code snapshot for my OS?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The source code snapshots contain a file called "README.OS" (like Readme.win32,
					Readme.MacOSX) that explains everything. The instructions for Linux systems are 
					traditionally in the file called INSTALL.
				</para>
			</body>

		<sub name="latest_version">
			<header>What is the latest version of <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The current official release is 1.4.9 RC1.<br/>
					See also <ref target="whereis_exult"/>
					to learn where to get the latest version.
				</para>
				<para>
					To find out which version you are running, press <key>v</key> while in game.
				</para>
				<para>
					Even though it is labeled RC1 (release candidate 1) we recommend that people use 
					this version rather than our very old last official version.

		<sub name="what_platforms">
			<header>On what platform does <Exult/> run?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> should be able to be compiled (with minor modifications) on
					any platform that SDL supports. Right now the source can be compiled
					in Linux/i386, Linux/Alpha, MacOS (requires at least MacOS 8.5 or higher),
					OS X, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, BeOS and Win32 (Windows 9x/ME/NT4/2000/XP/Vista/7).
				</para>
				 <para>
					Artaxerxes developed the port to
					<extref target="http://www.myzaurus.com/">Zaurus</extref>, a Linux/ARM based PDA.
					It is already fully playable (Artaxerxes played through SI). Pictures of the Zaurus
					running SI can be found at
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/images/screenshots/zaurus/"/> and an
					IPK package at <extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php"/>.
				 </para>
				<para>
					Ruediger Hanke's ported <Exult/> to MorphOS and AmigaOS. Unfortunately the port has 
					been abandoned for quite some time now
					You can only find the archived homepage for this port at 
					<extref target="http://web.archive.org/web/20070927190600/http://www.muenster.de/~tomjoad/exult.html"/>.
					Unfortunately the download is no longer available and thus the port is probably abandoned.

		<sub name="pocketpc_port">
			<header>Will a port for Pocket PC be available anytime?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Lanica Dragon successfully ported <Exult/> to the PocketPC and made snapshots 
					available on our download page.
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="any_port">
			<header>Will there be a port of <Exult/> for &lt;insert platform here&gt;?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					That depends on a great many things. For one, it requires a developer that (1) has the 
					necessary free time, (2) the necessary knowledge about programming for the platform in 
					question, (3) the necessary motivation to do the port and (4) access to the platform in 
					question. Any of the <Exult/> developers may lack one or more of the items above, but it 
					will probably the fourth (and, by consequence, the third) item. This is likely fatal 
					for the port: programming using an emulator (if one is even available) may result in a 
					port that works on the emulator but not on the original (unless the emulator is that 
					good), and programming without any access at all to the platform in question is a 
					pointless and frustrating exercise in futility.
				</para>
				<para>
					Moreover, some platforms might require U7 and/or SI to come bundled with <Exult/>; that alone 
					would disqualify any official builds for legal reasons.

					It seems to run most of the available versions of the game. The most common

					run for sure.
				</para>
				<para>
					In the past there were reported problems with the localized versions of the
					game (French, German and Spanish) but these should not be a problem anymore. 
					The reported problems were that conversation threads didn't seem to skip to the

					SI was published in English and Spanish (as we recently discovered to our surprise)
					but we seem to have fixed the main problem with the Spanish version.

					I can't say much about the what will happen except that a completely

				</cite>
				<cite name="Jeff">
					My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all
					the work so far on it. I'd much prefer to add enhancements to BG
					(which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG.
					Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals,
					that would change things. And also, since <Exult/> is open-source,
					it would be fine if anyone wants to volunteer to work on SI.

					<Exult/> savegames are compatible on all supported Operating Systems. For example
					a saved game of the Mac port of <Exult/> works on Windows 98 as well.
				</para>
				<para>
					However it is not advisable to use savegames of games started with the 1.4.9 RC1
					version of <Exult/> with an older release. And since we fixed many bugs since version
					1.2 we do not recommend that you continue games started with 1.2 (or earlier).

					<em>Don't!</em> You may be able to find it on the net but it would be

				<para>
					You can find exult.cfg in specific directories:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>On UNIX systems you can expect to find it in $HOME/.exult.cfg</li>
					<li>Mac OS X saves it to ~/Library/Preferences/exult.cfg</li>
					<li>Windows 95, 98, 98 SE and NT4.0 save the exult.cfg to the folder where you installed <Exult/> to 
						(by default C:\Program Files\Exult)</li>
					<li>Windows ME saves exult.cfg to C:\Windows\Application Data\Exult</li>
					<li>Windows 2000 and XP save exult.cfg to LOCAL_APPDATA\Exult, which translates to 
						C:\Documents and Settings\YourUsername\Local Settings\Application Data\Exult for an English version 
						of Windows</li>
					<li>Windows Vista and Windows 7 also save exult.cfg to LOCAL_APPDATA\Exult, but on these this translates 
						to "C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Exult"</li>
					<li>On Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7 you can quickly access this folder by executing "shell:Local AppData\Exult" 
						in the "Run" entry of the Startmenu (or the "Run or Search" entry of the Windows Vista and 7 Startmenu)</li>

			<header>Why is the party formation different?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					In <Exult/> the party (the Avatar and his companions) move quite differently than
					they do in the original. The problem is that this was controlled by the original
					executable. Changing the formation now is not as easy as it sounds as the party
					formation has effects on other game internals. Changing it to be more like the
					original may force us to replay the whole game to make sure we didn't introduce
					new bugs.
				</para>
				<para>
					Some time ago Jeff added an optional formation that behaves way more like in the
					original game and it has become the default formation now.<br/>
					This can be changed in the <extref doc="docs" target="exult_config">exult.cfg</extref>.
				</para>
				<cite name="Jeff">
					It's not a bug, it's a feature! I like it that way.  Everyone is sensitive to

		<sub name="save_crash">

				<para>
					This is <strong>not</strong> normal behavior for <Exult/>. Normally when you restart
					and "Journey Onward" <Exult/> will actually restore to the point you saved.
				</para>
				<para>
					<em>Please do not play further</em> at this point. You should restore to an earlier
					save game, no matter how much game time you loose. Your game must have gotten
					corrupted and when you play on with it you will most likely experience even more
					serious problems.
				</para>
				<para>
					Please also avoid saving when a scripted sequence is running. Whenever you can't control
					the Avatar on your own a scripted scene is running and saving at this time will break the

					Edit your exult.cfg (see <extref doc="docs" target="exult_config"/>) to disable
					full screen. If <Exult/> now runs fine in a window you have to select a different

		<sub name="improvements">
			<header>
				What are the improvements in <Exult/> over the original Ultima 7?</header>
			<body>
				<ul>
				<li>Many more keyboard shortcuts than the original had. Including in BG the
					<key>k</key> key that checks if you have the right key for a lock in your
					inventory. The list of keys can be found in the Documentation.</li>
				<li>A new worked over Game Options menu. This menu is explained in detail in the
					<extref target="docs.php">Documentation</extref> and many of the following
					improvements  and Video/Audio options can be accessed via this menu. Open
					this Game Options Menu by pressing <key>Esc</key> in the game.</li>
				<li>SI style paperdoll (inventory screen) in BG. Very impressive. For this you
					need to have Serpent Isle installed on your hard drive and you must set the
					path to it in exult.cfg (see the Documentation) and activate it in the
					Gameplay Options<br/>.
					This new inventory screen acts sometimes a little buggy, so if an item seems
					to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Gameplay Options.</li>
				<li>A beautiful new save game box. This allows you much more save games than
					the original (you should run out of disc space before you run out of save game
					slots), shows a screenshot of the location you saved at, the members of your
					party, your stats, game time and the date you actually saved. The save game
					box is opened either via the game menu or the <key>s</key> key.</li>
				<li>Face status bars at the bottom of the screen that show your health (and that
					of your party members) as well as your mana. Double-clicking on the face opens
					the inventory and double-clicking on the bars shows the status screen.</li>
				<li>Middle mouse button support. In the normal game, the middle mouse button
					activates the target-function (which could also be accomplished by pressing
					't'). for modal gumps, the middle mouse acts as 'return', the right button
					as 'escape', so you can now for example accept the default slider value by
					just pressing the middle button. The escape function is also available
					during most other actions like selecting a target or conversations.</li>
				<li>Wheel mouse support. If you have a wheel mouse some features are auto-enabled
					in <Exult/>.<br/>
					In slider gumps (e.g. how much gold you want to
					drop), scrolling the mouse up/down, moves the slider either left or right.
					Holding down <key>Alt</key> while using the wheel scrolls 10 steps.<br/>
					The save game menu scrolls one line, while pressing <key>Alt</key> it scrolls
					pages.<br/>
					You can also scroll the map of the game up or down and while pressing
					<key>Alt</key>  you scroll left or right.</li>
				<li>Fast Mouse which makes the mouse cursor move faster in full screen mode.</li>
				<li>Multiracial Avatar in BG. As with the paperdoll support you need to have SI
					installed and the path set in exult.cfg.</li>
				<li>Higher resolutions than the original. You can set the resolution as high as
					your computer supports. But there are some issues with it and it is considered
					cheating.</li>
				<li>Compressed save games. <Exult/> compresses save games by default as
					zip files. They are still labeled *.sav and have the save game name in the zip
					comment.</li>
				<li>A notebook for making notes and the possibility to automatically add notes</li>
				</ul>

		<sub name="paperdoll_issues">

				Are there issues with the SI style paperdoll in BG?

			<body>
				<para>
					There are some issues. The paperdoll in BG is still limited to the slots
					it had originally.<br/>
					That means:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>You can either equip a pair of gauntlets or one/two rings.</li>
					<li>The 'shield behind back', 'weapon behind back' and 'belt' slots are one
					and the same in BG. (So if you have a weapon on your back, you can't use your
					belt slot)</li>
					<li>If an item seems to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Game
					Options, retrieve the item and enable the paperdolls again.</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					Sparks paperdoll looks very odd (Spark on steroids) as there is no paperdoll
					for kids in SI and we have to use the adult paperdoll. Unless someone draws
					heaps of art we can't do anything.

					To get an Ultima 7 that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible there
					are several things to do (though I wonder why you'd want to do that):

				<li>make custom key bindings files (see <extref target="docs.php">Documentation</extref>)
					in which you disable all the keys that were not in the original for Black Gate and
					Serpents Isle.<br/>
					To enable the old save game menu you have to assign <key>s</key> to old_file_gump
					(the line in your custom key bindings file should look like: S old_file_gump)</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys.</li>
				<li>Disable SI-style paperdolls for BG in exult.cfg (see the documentation for that).</li>
				<li>Alternatively click on the disk icon and disable the paperdolls in the Gameplay Options.</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and
					disable scalers.</li>

					be altered. Sorry!</li>

			<body>
				<ol>
				<li>Read the <extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/docs.php">Documentation</extref>
					and this FAQ to see if that is not already covered and you have all set up correctly.</li>
				<li>Before you report a bug to the
					<extref target="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=2335">bug tracker</extref>
					please try the latest
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php">snapshot</extref>.
					If the bug still occurs make sure that no one else already reported the bug
					(in the bug tracker).</li>
				<li>Right now you can only submit a bug report in our tracker if you are a SourceForge member.
					We are sorry for this slight inconvenience (signing up on SourceForge is free and easy) but 
					the bug tracker had been plagued by spam attacks and valid bugs were pushed further down.
					The upside of this is that if we have questions or fix this bug you will get automatically 
					notified by eMail.</li>
				<li>Make sense in the topic! For example, if the problem is with Rowenna in Skara Brae
					don't just choose "Skara Brae" in the topic. "BG: Rowenna crashes game" makes more
					sense. Sadly the space for the topics is limited. Explain the topic in "Detailed
					Description".</li>
				<li>Include information on what version of <Exult/> you are using. You should have used
					the latest snapshot but please tell us the date of the snapshot.</li>
				<li>State which Operating System you use (Windows 9X, Linux, ...).</li>
				<li>Please include a save game (use common sense if it is really needed). You will find
					those in the game directories you put in the exult.cfg. They are called exult**bg.sav
					(** is a number) for BG and exult**si.sav for SI. You can look up the filename in the
					save game dialog as well (to the right, above the party members). As some parts of the game
					may require you to complete other quests or stuff before you get to the bug you want to
					report it's much easier for the team to look at the problem (speeds the process up a bit
					as they are much more likely you take a look at the problem this way).</li>
				<li>You may be asked to provide the log files of <Exult/>. These are named stdout.txt and 
					stderr.txt and can be found where exult.cfg is saved to, see 
					<ref1 target="where_cfg"/>.</li>
				<li>You may be asked to provide the log files of <Studio/>. These are named studio_out.txt and 
				studio_err.txt and can be found where exult.cfg is saved to, see 
				<ref1 target="where_cfg"/>.</li>
				<li><em>One</em> bug per subject please.</li>
				</ol>
				<para>
					Any bug report that requires a save game will most likely be
					<strong>tagged invalid</strong> if we don't receive a save game after we requested it.
				</para>
				<para>
					You can also use our
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/forum/">forum</extref>
					to report bugs. But if you do please follow the guidelines mentioned above (you can't
					include a save game of course). Though be aware that bugs submitted to the bug tracker
					are more likely to get attention than bugs submitted to the forum.<br/>
					And if you report to the forum, also follow the "one bug per report" rule, a post with 
					many bug reports in it is likely to have some bugs overlooked in the end.

			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> often behaves and works differently than the original Ultima 7. These
					behaviors are sometimes features that just differ from the way the original
					worked.<br/>
					Some are bugs that the development team consider to have almost no detrimental
					effect to the enjoyment/running of the game, but would require a large amount
					of time and effort to fix.<br/>
					Please don't bother the team about those as some of these will be fixed in the
					future, others will only be fixed when someone who thinks it should be done
					differently sits down and codes it.<br/>
					The following are such 'features' of <Exult/>:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>Birds and animals open doors and such, like the human and sentient
						creatures of Britannia do. You should rarely encounter this anymore 
						since there are better intelligence checks, but it can still happen.</li>
					<li>The way the Avatar and the companions walk. Is it 2 frames or 3 frames?
						This has been changed a lot as this was disputed almost every four weeks.
						Finally it works like the original and the Avatar uses two frames and the
						companions use three frames.</li>
					<li>Some music loops endlessly in <Exult/>. This is actually a correction of a bug
						in the original. We respects the midi looping flag as set by U7's original data

			<header>Why can't I see my location on the map (BG+SI)?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					To see your location marked on the map with a yellow cross you need to have sextant 
					in your inventory. And you need to be in the open. Since you can't use a sextant 
					under a roof, in a cave or in a dungeon you will not see your position marked there.

					You never could do this in the original as well. You have to use the

			<body>
				<para>
					"I'm trying to get Forsythe in Skara Brae to sacrifice himself to destroy the well of
					souls. But I can't seem to get Rowenna or Trent to talk to me about sacrifice."<br/>
					The solution to this is that Rowenna and Trent are standing too far apart. When you
					reunited the pair you initiated the conversation with Trent from too far away
					(this happens when you run at a higher resolution than the original one).<br/>
					Now you can either reload a game from before you reunited them or you have to hackmove
					Rowenna closer to Trent. After that the two will talk to you about sacrifice.
				</para>
				<para>
					Stuart Hillman told us of another way around this bug: Stand next to Trent when talking to Rowenna
					and next to her when talking to Trent.

			<header>Why can't I talk to the mayor of Skara Brae (BG)?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					You might be talking to "The Other Forsythe"(TM). There's a ghost in the Skara Brae
					town hall that looks like Forsythe, but isn't.<br/>
					This was fixed in more recent versions of <Exult/> but with games started with earlier
					versions this bug is still present. You need to start a new game of <Exult/> to fix
					this. But this bug poses no problem, so if you don't want to start a new game,
					just ignore that clone and search for the real Forsythe.

			<header>Multiple problems with the tetrahedron generator and prism (BG)?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Some of our users have problems entering the generator and finding the prism afterwards.
				</para>
				<para>
					To enter the tetrahedron generator you have to wear the ethereal ring (enchanted by Penumbra). 
					It is important to <strong>wear</strong> the ring on a finger and not just hold it like a weapon.
				</para>
				<para>
					After you defeated the enemy you have to double click the prism to destroy the generator.
					You will then find the black prism (without the yellow outline) to your feet. Look 
					closely and take it with you.

			<body>
				<para>
					At a certain point in the game Alagnar is supposed to be murdered. Unfortunately
					there is a bug in the original game data, that lets him walk around alive in his
					own murder scene. To avoid this bug you have to enter his house through the south door.

				<para>
					For forging the black sword you need to bind the demon to the gem you got from
					that invincible dragon you met in the test of courage. Some people mistake that
					little dark-blue gem with the glowing gem you received from Lord British.<br/>
					If you use the glowing gem on the isle of fire it just vanishes with a shattering
					sound.

				<para>
					The pikeman that lets you enter the list field in Monitor sometimes disappears due
					to a bug in the game (even the original).<br/>
					This bug occurs when you enter the banquet scene of Monitor. To avoid this bug, we
					recommend, that you approach the banquet hall from the right and/or double-click the
					entrance door to the hall when the party is standing very close to it.

					When you are at the Sleeping Bull, do <em>NOT</em> close the gangplank to Captain Hawk's ship.
					After you've got him out of Jail and you are ready for him to take you to Moonshade, he will
					not be able to do so when the gangplank is closed. If you have accidentaly done that you will

				<para>
					Fedabiblio in Moonshade sends you on a quest to find fresh Mandrake Roots. You get
					to Monk Island but can't find the any fresh roots.<br/>
					The problem is that fresh roots only appear depending on the tide. One of the nameless
					monks of the island tells you to ask him when the tide is right. Keep coming back to him
					and when he tells you the tide is right walk to the northern shore of the island to find
					fresh roots.

					Pothos won't take the moss if he hasn't sent you to fetch it for him. If you want 
					him to tell you about the mad mage and how to get to him you first have to talk with
					Bucia (also in Moonshade) about Pothos. Then you can talk to Pothos about it and he will
					sent you off to fetch him fresh blood moss. Read what he says because it is important to
					get fresh blood moss.

		<sub name="great_hierophant">

			<body>
				<para>
					If you follow some walkthrough you might find that your summoning of the
					Great Hierophant doesn't work. This is a problem with the walkthrough. You
					need to have a personal item of the Great Hierophant in your inventory, namely
					the Serpent Staff.
				</para>
				<para>
					If possible don't just play following the walkthrough, but go out and explore
					Serpent Isle. It's hard to imagine someone could miss the cave to the east of

					For Xenka to speak about sacrifice some parts of the game need to have been played

				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>you have returned the amulet to the Gwani <strong>AND</strong></li>
					<li>you have spoken with the Chaos Hierophant <strong>AND</strong></li>

		<sub name="si_npc_gone">
			<header>Where did XY disappear to (SI)?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					SI is very plot driven, so to stop people from breaking the plot, certain NPCs
					stay in a unaccessible spot on the map until you meet them by following the plot,
					or disappear from the map until they are needed again. If you cheat by 
					teleporting to them before the scripted meeting you are bound to break the plot 
					and most likely forced to reload an earlier savegame or start the whole game again.<br/>
					So please take care when teleporting around the map.

		<sub name="karnax_gone">
			<header>Why can't I find Karnax and the other monks (SI)?</header>

					See the above question. You have to use the Dark Path to make the monks appear 
					on Monk Island. If you just use the teleport cheat they won't show up.

		<sub name="serpent_staff">
			<header>An important note about the Serpent Staff (SI)</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The Serpent Staff in SI is a very important item. It doesn't seem like it but
					it is crucial to some major plot elements that you have the staff in your
					possession.<br/>
					Unfortunately the game also demands that you get the staff properly. For that I
					recommend to get it without cheating and to stand right next to it.
				</para>
				<para>
					Just picking it up and not transferring it to the inventory at once, but instead 
					putting it on the ground again could break later plot. Willem coded a workaround
					in <Exult/> so the problem might disappear.
				</para>

		<sub name="pillars_fort">
			<header>How to break the plot by double clicking some pillars (SI-SS)</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					In the dining hall of the fort in the add-on Silver Seed you can double click the
					pillars. This teleports you to the test in the gargoyle city. If you haven't done
					this test yet this breaks that plot later on and if you already have it is still a
					nuisance. So better don't do it.
				</para>
				<para>
					Obviously a slight oversight of the add-on designers. Could be fixed by changing the
					usecode and the map slightly.

			<header>What is <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But,
					being a DOS game with a very nonstandard memory manager, it is difficult
					to run it on the latest computers. <Exult/> is a project to create
					an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems, capable of
					using the data and graphics files that come with the game.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> is written in C++ and runs on, at least, Linux, Mac OS X and Windows
					using the SDL library to make porting to other platforms relatively easy.
					The current version supports all of &quot;Ultima 7: The Black Gate&quot;
					and &quot;Ultima 7 part 2: The Serpent Isle&quot;, allowing you to
					finish both games. This is only possible due to the work done
					by other fans who have decoded the various Ultima 7 data files,
					especially Gary Thompson, Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Schonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993)
					play the game on modern hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing)
					its original splendor as is possible. You need to <strong>own</strong>
					"Ultima 7: The Black Gate" and/or "Ultima 7: Serpent Isle" and optionally
					the add-ons (not required to run) in order to use <Exult/>,
					and we encourage you to buy a legal copy.

		<sub name="terms">
			<header>Terms we use in regard to Exult and Ultima 7</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					We are using many terms in this documentation, the FAQ and other documentation
					files that people may have difficulties to understand. Here we will try to give
					some explanations.
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>BG</strong>, <strong>SI</strong>, <strong>FoV</strong>
					or <strong>SS</strong>:<br/>
						we refer to "Ultima 7: The Black Gate" as BG and to "Ultima 7: Serpent Isle"
						as SI. The add-ons "Forge of Virtue" and "Silver Seed" are called FoV and SS.</li>
					<li><strong>eggs</strong>:<br/>
						 these are trip-wires that can cause monsters to spawn, execute scripts, play 
						 music, change weather, trigger traps or teleport when you get near them.</li>
					<li><strong>flex files</strong>:<br/>
						 also known as flexes, these are used by the original to store the data files.
						Also when you choose to not use compressed save games (see save_compression_level in
						<extref doc="docs" target="exult_config"/>) our save games are also "flexed".</li>
					<li><strong>gumps</strong>:<br/>
						the windows used in the game interface for containers, characters, menus, etc..</li>
					<li><strong>paperdoll</strong>:<br/>
						when pressing <key>i</key> you get the inventory display. It's the picture of your
						characters body (or the bodies of your party members) onto which you can drag all
						kinds of equipment. The way this is displayed in SI is what we call
						<strong>paperdoll</strong>. We integrated this for BG as well.
						(see <extref doc="faq" target="improvements"/>).</li>
					<li><strong>shapes</strong>:<br/>
						shape files are the format used for storage of all graphics elements (from UI buttons
						to terrain features) of the games <Exult/> supports. Shapes may contain one or more
						frames (a frame is a single image).</li>
					<li><strong>snapshot</strong>:<br/>
						see <extref doc="faq" target="whatis_snapshot"/>.<br/>
						Please note that our documentation usually refers to the latest snapshot.</li>
					<li><strong>usecode</strong>:<br/>
						that's the scripting language that drives all of U7 (conversations, objects...).</li>
					<li><strong>Exult data folder</strong>:<br/>
						that's the folder where <Exult/> stores its data files (exult.flx, exult_bg.flx and
						exult_si.flx).</li>
					<li><strong>gamename</strong><br/>
						name of games that are set in exult.cfg's &lt;game&gt;, <Exult/> knows by default 
						the gamenames <em>blackgate</em>, <em>forgeofvirtue</em>, <em>serpentisle</em> 
						and <em>silverseed</em></li>

	<section title="Configurations">
		<sub name="installation">
			<header>Installation</header>
			<body>
				<ul>
					<li>First you need to get Ultima 7. Either you own it already, or
						you buy it somewhere.</li>
					<li>You need an installed version of Ultima 7 to run <Exult/> with.
						At <section_ref target="Installing the original Ultima VII games for use with Exult"/>
						we have a guide on how to install the original games.</li>
					<li>Copy the installed Ultima7 folder to an appropriate folder</li>
					<li>Download <Exult/> from our 
						<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php">download section</extref>
						and install it. The Windows version comes with an installer that asks for the 
						location of both BG and SI. If you entered the correct location the next two 
						steps are not necessary.</li>
					<li>Now run <strong>exult</strong> (<strong>exult.exe</strong> on Windows)
						and quit it immediately.</li>
					<li>Edit the configuration file with a text editor (e.g. on Windows use Notepad) 
						and enter the correct paths for the game folders - see <ref target="exult_config"/>
						for details</li>
					<li>Run <strong>exult</strong> and enjoy the game :-)</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					<strong>Word of advice:</strong> Don't mix the files from BG and SI.
				</para>
				<para>
					<strong>Note:</strong> If you run <Exult/> on an original Ultima7
					game which you're actually in the middle of playing, your game
					will be overwritten. Since <Exult/>'s files
					have a different format, there is no way to convert those
					original save games.
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="exult_config_location">
			<header>Location of exult.cfg</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> stores its setting in the file exult.cfg. The location of the file varies depending on 
					the Operating System and in the case of Windows OS it also depends on the version of Windows.
				</para>
					<ul>
						<li>On UNIX systems you can expect to find it in $HOME/.exult.cfg</li>
						<li>Mac OS X saves it to ~/Library/Preferences/exult.cfg</li>
						<li>Windows 95, 98, 98 SE and NT4.0 save the exult.cfg to the folder where you installed <Exult/> to 
						(by default C:\Program Files\Exult)</li>
						<li>Windows ME saves exult.cfg to C:\Windows\Application Data\Exult</li>
						<li>Windows 2000 and XP save exult.cfg to LOCAL_APPDATA\Exult, which translates to 
							C:\Documents and Settings\YourUsername\Local Settings\Application Data\Exult for an English version 
							of Windows</li>
						<li>Windows Vista and Windows 7 also save exult.cfg to LOCAL_APPDATA\Exult, but on these this translates 
							to "C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Exult"</li>
						<li>On Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7 you can quickly access this folder by executing "shell:Local AppData\Exult" 
							in the "Run" entry of the Startmenu (or the "Run or Search" entry of the Windows Vista and 7 Startmenu)</li>
					</ul>

		<sub name="exult_config">
			<header>Settings in exult.cfg</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Most of the options in <Exult/> can be changed from the <strong>Setup</strong> 
					menu when you run <Exult/> or via the Game Options menu. <Exult/> stores these 
					changes in a configuration file. Except for changing paths to the games you
					shouldn't need to edit the file. Very few options need manual editing.
				</para>
				<para>
					<em>Note:</em> the settings in exult.cfg are the <strong>same</strong> on
					<strong>all</strong> operating systems (except when explicitly stated below).
				</para>
				<para>
					The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should be simple to
					understand and modify. Take care though. Handling of syntax errors in this file
					is not well tested.
				</para>
				<para>
					The file looks like this (do not copy the **and following - these are my remarks), 
					options you can only change manually are colored in purple.

					The way <Exult/> generates default paths (for gamedat, savegames, mods, patches) has changed since Version 1.2. It will
					not write these paths to exult.cfg but use them automatically.<br/>
					The location where <Exult/> expects those, and if needed, will create those folders is similarly depending on the Operating 
					System as the location of exult.cfg (see <ref1 target="exult_config_location"/>).
					If you were to override these paths you would need to change the following tags (you can substitute gamename with the 
					"known games" - see <ref target="terms"/>):

					But normally you don't need to. On starting up, <Exult/> will first read which games are available as configured in exult.cfg. 
					Then it will use the &lt;path&gt; setting and assume that &lt;static_path&gt; is &lt;path&gt;/static.<br/>
					For &lt;savegame_path&gt;, &lt;gamedat_path&gt;, &lt;mods&gt; and &lt;patch&gt; <Exult/> will assume Operating System specific paths.

					These folders are used for:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>&lt;data_path&gt;<br/>
						the most important folder. In this folder are the files <Exult/> absolutely needs to run. We also check the checksums of these 
						files to make sure that <Exult/> uses the correct ones.</li>
					<li>&lt;static_path&gt;<br/>
						the second most important folder. In there you have the data files from the original game. You should 
						never touch these files.</li>
					<li>&lt;savegame_path&gt;<br/>
						this is where <Exult/> stores your savegames.</li>
					<li>&lt;gamedat_path&gt;<br/>
						contains the (dynamic) data for the game you're currently playing. It's where the 
						"journey onward" and "quicksave" 'savegame' is stored.</li>
					<li>&lt;mods&gt;<br/>
						here mods for games are saved to. More information on this at <ref1 target="mods_intro"/></li>

						Patches for games are saved here. More information on this at <ref1 target="mods_intro"/></li>

					Some notes for <strong>all</strong> Operating Systems:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li>On Windows all of these settings, except for the &lt;path&gt; setting, are <strong>optional and not required</strong>,
						Exult will sort this out on its own.</li>
					<li>On *nix and OS X you might even not need to touch the &lt;path&gt; setting, if you stick to our standard gamenames.</li>
					<li>You can either use the relative (e.g. ./ultima7) or absolute (e.g. c:\exult\ultima7) path to point to the 
						correct folder. The relative path uses the exult.exe, exult binary or Exult.app as base.</li>
					<li>Better don't use spaces in the path (e.g. c:\exult\the black gate\). Some people seem to have reported 
						problems with that.</li>
					<li>Path settings in exult.cfg are the <strong>same</strong> on <strong>all</strong> operating systems. Of course 
						you need to make adjustments on *nix based systems when you enter the absolute path.</li>
					<li><Exult/> and <Studio/> don't trust the exult.cfg 100% and will recognize which games
						you entered the path for. This means, that if you entered the path to SI in the 
						&lt;blackgate&gt;&lt;path&gt; <Exult/> and <Studio/> will not be fooled.</li>
					<li>Don't ever point &lt;static_path&gt; and &lt;gamedat_path&gt; to the same folder.</li>

					on Windows 2000 and XP to "C:\Documents and Settings\YourUsername\Local Settings\Application Data\Exult" 
					and on Windows Vista and W7 to "C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Exult".<br/>
					Also not that on Windows 2000, XP, Vista and 7 you can quickly access this folder by executing 
					"shell:Local AppData\Exult" in the "Run" entry of the Startmenu (or the "Run or Search" entry of 
					the Windows Vista and 7 Startmenu).<br/>
					For now <Exult/>'s data folder is always installed into the same folder where you installed 
					<Exult/> to (default is C:\Program Files\Exult).<br/>
					Also not that in contrast to Mac OS X and *nix systems there is no default path, where <Exult/> looks
					for the games. You have to choose that folder yourself, but the installer will ask you for the BG and SI 
					folder to set your paths up.

					Example: User named <strong>Dominus</strong> on <strong>Windows XP</strong>. BG is installed to C:\Ultima7\blackgate 
					and SI is installed to C:\Ultima7\serpentisle. The installer of <Exult/> asks for the location of 
					these two games and automatically saves that to exult.cfg. The installer saves exult.cfg to

					Note that on OS X <Exult/> also has a default folder (/Library/Application Support/Exult/) 
					for <Exult/>'s data and the files of the games. On purpose this folder is not in the User-only 
					space, so other users on the same mac can play the games and use the Exult.app.<br/>
					<strong>But</strong> you will need to follow our gamename standard when you name the game 
					folders, see <ref1 target="terms"/>, otherwise <Exult/> will not find them there.<br/>
					Another specialty on OS X is that the Exult.app comes bundled with the <Exult/> data, so 
					<Exult/> will first use the data in the Exult.app and then use the data in the default location 
					(/Library/Application Support/Exult/data) or the location written down in exult.cfg's &lt;data_path&gt;.
					This means that you can copy the sfx files and the digital music folder into the app bundle 
					(Exult.app/Contents/Resources/data) and Exult will automatically use these.
				</para>
				<para>
					Example: User named <strong>Dominus</strong> on <strong>Mac OS X 10.6</strong>. BG is installed to 
					/Library/Application Support/Exult/blackgate and SI is installed to /Library/Application Support/Exult/serpentisle. 
					The app Exult.app is saved to /Applications. When you run <Exult/> it will automatically recognize that BG and SI 
					are installed. You do not need to edit exult.cfg, which is saved to /Users/Dominus/Library/Preferences/exult.cfg.
					When you save a game in BG the savegame will be saved to 
					/Users/Dominus/Library/Application Support/exult/blackgate/exult00bg.sav,

					If you install for example the keyring mod, you copy the contents of the Keyring.zip to

					<li>--si<br/>
						Starts the game with the Serpent Isle menu (prefers original game).</li>
					<li>--ss<br/>
						Starts the game with the menu of the Serpent Isle with Silver Seed expansion.

						x = 0 shows all roofs, x = 2 pops them all.<br/>
						You have to specify the game first (Example: exult --bg --buildmap 0).<br/>
						Builds the map of the game specified. The map is <strong>huge</strong> and in pcx
						format, you will need a lot of ram to even look at this map once it is build
						(and even that requires a lot of patience)<br/>
						<Exult/> is required to be run in windowed mode and you get the best map if you
						started a new game before you build the map.<br/>
						You need to specify a game, either by '--bg' (or '--si', '--fov', '--ss') or

					<li>--nocrc<br/>
						Recently we added a crc check that <Exult/> doesn't start when the
						exult*.flx files in the data folder aren't the same it got compiled with.
						This parameter lets the game start nevertheless. Don't try this if you
						don't know what you are doing.</li>
					<li>--game gamename<br/>
						Loads a game specified in exult.cfg when there are other games made
						with <Studio/>.</li>
					<li>--edit<br/>
						Start in map-edit mode. This will also load <Studio/> when the game is started.</li>
					<li>--write-xml<br/>
						Write 'patch/exultgame.xml'. Only useful for game editing.</li>
					<li>--mod modname<br/>
						Must be used together with '--bg', '--si' or '--game gamename'; runs the specified 
						game using the mod with title equal to 'modname'. 'modname' is the name of the mod 
						cfg file (e.g. keyring.cfg means 'modname' 'keyring'.</li>

					There are three general ways that music is played in <Exult/>. One is using MIDI, which 
					plays the music through any MIDI device, or software synthesizers like TiMidity and 
					FluidSynth. Another way is Digital Music encoded into OGG (similar to MP3) which was 
					recorded directly from a Roland MT-32. The third option is FMOpl which emulates 
					Opl2/Adlib.<br/>
					The MIDI files are converted on-the-fly from the original Ultima 7 MT-32 files to 
					General MIDI format so that they will be playable on modern General MIDI and 
					General MIDI/GS supporting sound cards.

					The MIDI driver can be changed to:
				</para>

      				<li><strong>Default</strong><br/>
        				This setting utilizes the default MIDI driver of your system.</li>
      				<li><strong>FMOPL</strong><br/>
      					This is a Software FM Synthesizer (also known as a emulated Opl2/Adlib).</li>
					<li><strong>TiMidity</strong><br/>
        				is a software synthesizer that can play MIDI files without a hardware synthesizer.
						You can install TiMidity on all major Operating systems. You need to place tmidity.cfg
						into the same folder where the <Exult/> executable is installed to, otherwise TiMidity 
						will not work.</li>
					<li><strong>FluidSynth</strong><br/>
        				is another software synthesizer, which uses SoundFont 2 technology without need for a 
						SoundFont-compatible sound card. It is available for many Operating Systems and opposed 
						to TiMidity still actively developed.<br/>
						Since Fluidsynth pulls in many dependencies it is not compiled into <Exult/> at the moment.
						If you compiled <Exult/> ourself and you enabled Fluidsynth you just need to edit 
						exult.cfg and point &lt;config&gt;&lt;audio&gt;&lt;midi&gt;&lt;fluidsynth_soundfont&gt; 
						to the SoundFont you want to use.</li>
					<li><strong>MT32Emu</strong><br/>
        				Roland MT32 emulation requires either the ROM set "MT32_CONTROL.ROM" and "MT32_PCM.ROM" or 
						the ROM set "CM32L_CONTROL.ROM" and "CM32L_PCM.ROM" in the <Exult/> data folder.
						If both sets are present the CM32L ROM set will be used.</li>
					<li><strong>Windows</strong><br/>
        				When you are using Windows and for some reason the <strong>Default</strong> driver doesn't work.</li>
					<li><strong>Amiga</strong><br/>
        				Uses the Amiga MIDI driver on the Amiga system.</li>
					<li><strong>Be_midi</strong><br/>

					<li><strong>CoreAudio</strong><br/>
        				uses XMIDI on Mac OS X.</li>
					<li><strong>CoreMIDI</strong><br/>
	        			with this MIDI driver a Real MT32 can be used on Mac OS X.</li>
					<li><strong>alsa</strong><br/>
        				uses ALSA on Linux systems. If your ALSA port is not on 65:0 you need to change
						&lt;config&gt;&lt;audio&gt;&lt;midi&gt;&lt;alsa_port&gt; in the exult.cfg.</li>
					<li><strong>Forked</strong><br/>
        				On *nix systems uses POSIX fork to create a new thread which will then handle the MIDI playback</li>
					<li><strong>KMIDI</strong><br/>
        				On Linux systems uses uses libkmidi, a KDE MIDI library.</li>

        				This option will output the music with nothing changed. Because
               			the mapping will be for MT32s you should only use this option if
               			you have a MT32 compatible device. With this option <Exult/> will 
						also send SysEx messages to the Roland MT32 display, which are nice 
						to watch when you have such a device.</li>
					<li><strong>GM</strong><br/>
						This will convert the MT32 patches to standard General MIDI patches.
     					Conversion is fairly accurate but some instruments may be different.</li>
					<li><strong>GS</strong><br/>
     					This will convert the MT32 patches to their equivalent GS patches. This
     					will be a more accurate conversion that straight gm since more of the
     					MT32 patches are in the GS set. However, not all MIDI devices will
     					support this mode.</li>
					<li><strong>GS127</strong><br/>
     					This option is for MIDI devices that have a MT32 patch bank installed
        				in Bank 127. Some GS implementation have this, some don't. Only use
        				this if you know that you have a MT32 implementation on Bank 127.</li>
					<li><strong>Fake MT32</strong><br/>
        				This is for MIDI devices that behave like a MT32 but don't support 
						SysEx messages. Use that option if you have a SoundFont or similar loaded 
						for your sound card (or software synth such as FluidSynth) that contains 
						the MT32 capital tones but the device can't be reprogrammed using MT32 
						SysEx commands by <Exult/>.</li>

					<Exult/> needs the Digital Music pack to play Digital Music in the game. The music
					pack contains music for both Black Gate and Serpent Isle, encoded in high quality
					OGG format. Simon Quinn recorded the current Digital Music pack on an original
					Roland MT-32 and with this you will experience the music as it would be heard with
					the original game.<br/>
					Digital Music should work on any platform that supports digital sound and does not
					use any MIDI, so it is also a good option for platforms with no MIDI support.
					Additionally, Digital Music supports a number of background atmospheric SFX tracks
					that are played when no music is playing. These consist of wind, bird etc effects
					outside and other sound effects when inside a dungeon. These SFX tracks are not
					available when using MIDI as they play Roland MT-32 specific voices that cannot
					be mapped to GM/GS. These SFX tracks do not play when the music is switched off.
				</para>
				<para>
					The digital music pack seems to have two issue, though, some tracks seem to have 
					been recorded at lower volume than the others. Also, since both the digital music 
					and the sound effects are played by the Wave / PCM of your sound card, you can no 
					longer have a different volume for music and sound effects.

					If you are not sure where the data folder is, search for the file

					<Exult/> needs the so called SFX packs to enable sound effects for Ultima 7.
					You have to download separate packs for each game as order of the SFX in BG
					and SI varies a bit and otherwise will sound odd. However there is a little
					issue with SFX playback in SI: In combat the SFX may be a little wrong as we
					still haven't figured out all the data in the 'weapons.dat'.<br/>
					Also <Exult/> doesn't yet playback all the SFX that the original did.
				</para>
				<para>
					 We currently have two soundpacks for each game. Joseph Morris recorded the original
					 SoundBlaster SFX and Simon Quinn recorded the Roland MT32 SFX. You can find them on
					 our download page at
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php"/>.<br/>
					"Sound pack for Blackgate" and "Sound pack for Serpent Isle" are the SoundBlaster 
					sound effects.<br/>
					"Sound pack for Black Gate (Roland MT-32)" and "Sound pack for Serpent Isle (Roland MT-32)" 
					are the Roland MT32 sound effects.<br/>
					Don't be confused by the "Zaurus SI/BG SFX package", these are just the repackaged 
					SoundBlaster sound effects for the Zaurus device. If you don't have such a device, these 
					don't concern you.
				</para>
				<para>
					Extract the zip files into your <Exult/> data folder. <Exult/> will automatically find and 
					use the SFX packs and will default to use the Roland MT32 pack when both both packs 
					(SoundBlaster and Roland MT-32) are present. You can then choose between the packs in the 
					Game Menu (<ref target="audio_gump"/>), of course you can override this setting in the 
					exult.cfg (see <ref target="exult_config"/>).<br/>

			<body>
				<para>
					We distinguish between the <Exult/> display resolution (which determines 
					the size of the <Exult/> window and its fullscreen rendering) and the game 
					area, which determines how big the in-game viewing area is.<br/>
				</para>
				<para>
					By default <Exult/> runs the games at 320x200 (which is the resolution the 
					original Ultima VII used). <Exult/> can use different scaling engines to
					double the size to 640x400 or even triple the the size to 960x600 while 
					increasing  the quality of the graphics and maintaining the same viewing 
					area. This allows Exult to show the game as an enhanced version of how it 
					originally appeared, and not show locations that were originally off-screen.<br/> 
					When you first start <Exult/> we apply the scaler 2xSaI which doubles the size 
					of each pixel, resulting in a 640x400 window.
				</para>
				<para>
					You will also have to hit "Apply" in the Video gump to apply your changes. <Exult/> 
					will then use the new settings and will show you a countdown which asks you to confirm 
					that the new video settings are working. When yo don't confirm by hitting "YES", the 
					changes will be reverted. This way we try to prevent that some bad video options 
					combinations prevent you from playing the games.
				</para>
				<para>
					When you disallow same settings for window and fullscreen mode in the Game menu, 
					settings can be set for either fullscreen or windows mode just by selecting different 
					settings while using either mode.

		<sub name="video_fill_modes">
			<header>Fill modes</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The game area with scaler applied should not be bigger than the display, 
					otherwise you will get strange effects and the game might crash.<br/>
					For example when you set the game area to 320x200 with the scaler Point 
					at sale factor 3, your game viewing area is actually 960x600. If your display 
					resolution is set to 640x480 the resolutions don't match and your <Exult/> 
					window will be smaller than intended.<br/>
					<Exult/> will check whether this will happen and will warn you against it, since 
					making the window smaller than 320x200 will cause you trouble with <Exult/>s 
					interface and you might not be able to revert your changes.<br/>
				</para>
				<para>
					On the other hand when your display resolution is set higher than the game resolution 
					you can have black borders surrounding the game viewing area. The borders can be used
					for positioning gumps and the face stats.<br/>
					You can also change the color of the borders.<br/>
					If you don't like black borders you can also stretched to fill the entire display 
					resolution, or sacled to fit the display resolution without stretching the pixels.<br/>
					You have the following options
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Fill</strong><br/>
						ame screen is stretched to fill the entire display surface. No borders will be added 
						in this mode. The game screen will be downsampled if it is bigger than the display 
						surface in this mode.</li>
					<li><strong>Fit</strong><br/>
						Game is scaled to fill the display surface maintaining square pixels. Black borders 
						will be added to maintain aspect if needed. The game screen will be downsampled if it 
						is bigger than the display surface in this mode.</li>
					<li><strong>"Aspect Correct Fit"</strong><br/> 
						Same as fit, but pixels are additionally scaled using a 1:1.2 ratio. This corrects the
						aspect mismatch between the nonsquare pixels used by the original game and the square 
						pixels of modern screen resolutions.</li>					
					<li><strong>Centre</strong><br/>
						The game is centred on the display surface without additional scaling. Black borders will 
						be added if game screen is smaller than the display surface. Clipping will occur if the 
						game screen is larger than the display surface.</li>	
					<li><strong>"Aspect Correct Centre"</strong><br/>
						Same as Centre except height is scaled by 1.2x to correct pixel aspect mismatch..</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					If the Game Area setting is set to Auto then the game area is calculated based on the selected 
					fill mode with no additional scaling applied.<br/>
					The additional scaling method can be set to Point or Bilinear.

					Using higher resolutions is considered cheating as you can see too much of

					the stock SL-5500 ROM v2.12, but will work with some modifications on more recent 
					ROMs. It has been reported to work on the SL5000-D (the earlier and less capable 
					version). The package will not run of-the-shelf using the latest ROM (no matter 
					what version of the Zaurus you use) unless you make a couple of changes. More

					on my Zaurus, I plug the cradle via USB to my Linux machine (Mandrake 10.1). 
					Inserting the Zaurus on the cradle will automatically use the usbnet module to 
					access the Zaurus via USB-over-ethernet. I then assign an IP to the net device 
					usb0. Search the net to find out how. Once the connection is done, I upload the

					Using the standard ROM has lead people to some issues. I recommend you install a

					the /mnt/cf/exult-data/si/static folder. Simply copy the content of your U7's

			<body>
				<para>
					As mentioned earlier, <Exult/> won't run properly on the latest ROM 
					(v3.10 as of 20030801) without some changes. There are a few reason why. 
					I know they have changed the default user to be "zaurus" instead of "root", 
					which mess up the paths and the config file. Indeed, by default, <Exult/> 
					reads its config file on ~/.exult.cfg which gets expanded to /home/root/.exult.cfg 
					on the default ROM but to /home/zaurus/.exult.cfg on the newest ROM. Since 
					the package installs all user-related files to /home/root, <Exult/> won't find 
					them on the latest ROM. Not only ~/.exult.cfg is concerned, but also ~/.exult/ 
					which contains the gamedat (current running game) and the savegames. Finally, the 
					files' owner is set to "root" so the user "zaurus" won't be able to alter files 
					and folders.

					In order to play, you'll have to change the location of the files installed by the 
					package to /home/zaurus/ instead of /home/root/. You'll have to type "su" to be able 
					to change it. "su" is a command to become superuser (root).<br/>
					Not only you want to move the files ~/.exult.cfg and ~/.exult/ to /home/zaurus/ but 
					you also want to edit the ~/.exult.cfg so that every occurrence of /home/root/ is 
					replaced with /home/zaurus.<br/>
					First, open a terminal (install one if you don't have one).
				</para>
				<para>
					From the terminal, verify who you are by typing ($ is the prompt):<br/>
					<kbd>$ cd ~/</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>$ whoami</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>$ pwd</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					The "whoami" command should return "zaurus". The "pwd" command should
					return "/home/zaurus/".<br/>
					Then copy the <Exult/> files:<br/>
					<kbd>$ cp /home/root/.exult* ~/ -rf</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					And change ownership to yourself. You might have to become root to do
					so:<br/>
					<kbd>$ su</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /home/zaurus/.exult* -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /opt/QtPalmtop/share/exult -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /opt/QtPalmtop/bin/exult* -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /opt/QtPalmtop/pics/exult.png -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /opt/QtPalmtop/apps/Games/exult.desktop -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># exit</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					The # is the root's prompt. The "exit" command will stop the "su"
					command and make you return to the "zaurus" user. It is now time to
					edit the .exult.cfg. A fast way to do it:<br/>
					<kbd>$ sed -e 's/root/zaurus/' &gt;~/.exult.cfg ~/.exult.cfg_new</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>$ mv ~/.exult.cfg_new ~/.exult.cfg</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					Normally, you should be able to start and play the game normally.
					Let me know if I am missing anything.
				</para>
				<para>
					Updated packages will come up soon so that no additional work will be required.

			<body>
				<para>
					Insert Disk 1 in your floppy drive, open explorer and click on the floppy drive 
					(<strong>a:\</strong>). 
					Double click on install.exe, choose the drive you want to install to, and then in which 
					folder you want BG/SI to be installed to (Let's assume <strong>C:\Exult\ULTIMA7</strong> 
					for BG and <strong>C:\Exult\SERPENT</strong> for SI).<br/> 
					Next you choose the sound card, but as this is not relevant for <Exult/>, choose "No sound 
					card". Confirm the settings with "Y" and the installer begins to make noise in your 
					floppy drive...<br/>
					When asked to insert the next floppy disk and hit any key (or ESC to cancel). When the
					installation is done, the installer will complain, that "something has put your system 
					in protected mode...", ignore that and press any key to continue. Again it will complain 
					that "your current system configuration is not compatible with Ultima VII!...", ignore 
					that as well and press "N" (you don't need a bootdisk for playing U7 with <Exult/>). Finally 
					hit any key to finish your installation. The installer will finish and the game can be 
					found at <strong>C:\Exult\ULTIMA7</strong> or <strong>C:\Exult\SERPENT</strong>.
				</para>
				<para>
					When installing Ultima VII from floppy disks in Windows you can run into some problems.<br/>
					The installer assumes that all drives in the computer are hard drives and can't cope with
					drives like CD-ROMs and card readers. It tries to read how much free space the drives have 
					and if there is no media in the drive it gives an error and you can't proceed.<br/>
					To solve this you have to insert a CD-ROM in your CD/DVD-ROM drive. If you have a multi card 
					reader disconnect that if possible (or insert cards in all the slots if you have them). If 
					disconnecting the reader is not possible you have to use one of the other ways to install the
					floppy versions or use a different computer.
				</para>
				<para>
					Unfortunately it is possible that one of the floppies is no longer working. In that case the
					installation will fail and the installer might suggest that there is a device error and asks 
					you to reboot your computer. Don't follow that advice a reboot is not likely to fix it.

					not working on every computer, for some unknown reason the installer might crash at this point.<br/>
					If it doesn't crash the installer will write where it found BG/SI installed to and will ask

		<sub name="exult_version">
			<header>Exult Version</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					This documentation is for the 1.4.x CVS/SVN version of <Exult/>.
					If you have another <Exult/> version, its documentation can be found where you installed the release.

			<header>What is <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But,
					being a DOS game with a very nonstandard memory manager, it is difficult
					to run it on the latest computers. <Exult/> is a project to create
					an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems, capable of
					using the data and graphics files that come with the game.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> is written in C++ and runs on, at least, Linux, Mac OS X and Windows
					using the SDL library to make porting to other platforms relatively easy.
					The current version supports all of &quot;Ultima 7: The Black Gate&quot;
					and &quot;Ultima 7 part 2: The Serpent Isle&quot;, allowing you to
					finish both games. This is only possible due to the work done
					by other fans who have decoded the various Ultima 7 data files,
					especially Gary Thompson, Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993)
					play the game on modern hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing)
					its original splendor as is possible. You need to <strong>own</strong>
					"Ultima 7: The Black Gate" and/or "Ultima 7: Serpent Isle" and optionally
					the add-ons (not required to run) in order to use <Exult/>,
					and we encourage you to buy a legal copy.
				</para>

		<sub name="terms">
			<header>Terms we use in regard to Exult and Ultima 7</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					We are using many terms in this documentation, the FAQ and other documentation
					files that people may have difficulties to understand. Here we will try to give
					some explanations.
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>BG</strong>, <strong>SI</strong>, <strong>FoV</strong>
					or <strong>SS</strong>:<br/>
						we refer to "Ultima 7: The Black Gate" as BG and to "Ultima 7: Serpent Isle"
						as SI. The add-ons "Forge of Virtue" and "Silver Seed" are called FoV and SS.</li>
					<li><strong>eggs</strong>:<br/>
						 these are trip-wires that can cause monsters to spawn, execute scripts, play 
						 music, change weather, trigger traps or teleport when you get near them.</li>
					<li><strong>flex files</strong>:<br/>
						 also known as flexes, these are used by the original to store the data files.
						Also when you choose to not use compressed save games (see save_compression_level in
						<extref doc="docs" target="exult_config"/>) our save games are also "flexed".</li>
					<li><strong>gumps</strong>:<br/>
						the windows used in the game interface for containers, characters, menus, etc..</li>
					<li><strong>paperdoll</strong>:<br/>
						when pressing <key>i</key> you get the inventory display. It's the picture of your
						characters body (or the bodies of your party members) onto which you can drag all
						kinds of equipment. The way this is displayed in SI is what we call
						<strong>paperdoll</strong>. We integrated this for BG as well.
						(see <extref doc="faq" target="improvements"/>).</li>
					<li><strong>shapes</strong>:<br/>
						shape files are the format used for storage of all graphics elements (from UI buttons
						to terrain features) of the games Exult supports. Shapes may contain one or more
						frames (a frame is a single image).</li>
					<li><strong>snapshot</strong>:<br/>
						see <extref doc="faq" target="whatis_snapshot"/>.<br/>
						Please note that our documentation usually refers to the latest snapshot.</li>
					<li><strong>usecode</strong>:<br/>
						that's the scripting language that drives all of U7 (conversations, objects...).</li>
					<li><strong>Exult data directory</strong>:<br/>
						that's the directory where Exult stores its data files (exult.flx, exult_bg.flx and
						exult_si.flx).</li>
				</ul>

	<section title="Configurations">
		<sub name="installation">
			<header>Installation</header>
			<body>
				<ul>
					<li>First you need to get Ultima 7. Either you own it already, or
						you buy it somewhere.</li>
					<li>You need an installed version of Ultima 7 to run <Exult/> with.
						At <section_ref target="Installing the original Ultima VII games for use with Exult"/>
						we have a guide on how to install the original games.</li>
					<li>Copy the installed Ultima7 folder to an appropriate folder
					 	- see <ref target="path_config"/> for suggestions.</li>
					<li>Download <Exult/> from our 
						<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php">download section</extref>
						and install it. The Windows version comes with an installer that asks for the 
						location of both BG and SI. If you entered the correct location the next two 
						steps are not necessary.</li>
					<li>Now run <strong>exult</strong> (<strong>exult.exe</strong> in Windows)
						and quit it immediately.</li>
					<li>Edit the configuration file with a text editor (e.g. on Windows use Notepad) 
						and enter the correct paths for the game folders - see <ref target="exult_config"/>
						for details</li>
					<li>Run <strong>exult</strong> and enjoy the game :-)</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					<strong>Word of advice:</strong> Don't mix the files from BG and SI.
				</para>
				<para>
					<strong>Note:</strong> If you run <Exult/> on an original Ultima7
					game which you're actually in the middle of playing, your game
					will be overwritten. Since <Exult/>'s files
					have a different format, there is no way to convert those
					original save games.
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="exult_config">
			<header>Settings in exult.cfg</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> keeps a configuration file. You can specify where your Ultima 7
					installation is, whether you want full screen graphics, or windowed, and
					midi devices and midi settings. Some of these options can be set from the
					<strong>Setup</strong> menu when you run <Exult/> or via the Game Options menu.
				</para>
				<para>
					If you do not already have a configuration file, <Exult/> will make one for you
					filling in sensible defaults by itself. The location of this file varies
					slightly. On UNIX systems you can expect to find it in $HOME/.exult.cfg.
					In Windows it is 'exult.cfg' in the same directory as the <Exult/> binary 
					(where you installed <Exult/> to).
					In Mac OS X it is ~/Library/Preferences/exult.cfg.
				</para>
				<para>
					<em>Note:</em> the settings in exult.cfg are the <strong>same</strong> on
					<strong>all</strong> operating systems (except when explicitly stated below).
				</para>
				<para>
					The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should be simple to
					understand and modify. Take care though. Handling of syntax errors in this file
					is not well tested.
				</para>
				<para>
					The default file looks like this (do not copy the **and following
					- these are my remarks).
				</para>
				<para>
					Note: yes means enabled, no means disabled

					You have two choices on how to setup <Exult/>, though if you are on Windows, I recommend 
					running the setup and point to the correct directories for both BG and SI.
				</para>
				<para>
					The first one is very easy, just install <Exult/> to the directory where you have The Black
					Gate or Serpent Isle installed. Concerning the paths you don't have to
					configure anything, at least for the game you have installed it to. For the other game you will
					need to edit exult.cfg.
				</para>
				<para>
					The other is a little more complicated but appeals to control freaks like me:<br/>
					Make a directory c:\exult<br/>
					make two subfolders named "ultima7" and "serpent" (without the quotes of course)<br/>
					Extract or install the two Ultima 7 games into the appropriate folder
					("The Black Gate" to c:\exult\ultima7 and "Serpent Isle" to c:\exult\serpent)<br/>
					Install <Exult/> to c:\Exult.<br/>
					Now you have to edit the file c:\exult\exult.cfg file like this (Non-Windows users please look 
					at <ref target="exult_config"/> for the location of exult.cfg):

					Opl2/Adlib.<br/>
					The MIDI files are converted on-the-fly from the original Ultima 7 MT-32 files to

      				<li><strong>FMOPL</strong><br/>
      					This is a Software FM Synthesizer (also known as a emulated Opl2/Adlib).</li>
					<li><strong>Timidity</strong><br/>
        				is a software synthesizer that can play MIDI files without a hardware synthesizer.
						You can install TiMidity on all major Operating systems. You need to place tmidity.cfg
						into the same directory where the Exult executable is installed to, otherwise Timidity 
						will not work.</li>
					<li><strong>Fluidsynth</strong><br/>
        				is another software synthesizer, which uses SoundFont technology without need for a 
						SoundFont-compatible soundcard. It is availlable for many Operating Systems and opposed 
						to TiMidity still actively developed. At "config/audio/midi/fluidsynth_soundfont" in the 
						exult.cfg you will have to enter the path to the SoundFont you want to use.</li>
					<li><strong>MT32Emu</strong><br/>

						also send sysex messages to the Roland MT32 display, which are nice 
						to watch when you have such a device.</li>
					<li><strong>GM</strong><br/>
						This will convert the MT32 patches to standard General Midi patches.
     					Conversion is fairly accurate but some instruments may be different.</li>
					<li><strong>GS</strong><br/>
     					This will convert the MT32 patches to their equivalent GS patches. This
     					will be a more accurate conversion that straight gm since more of the
     					MT32 patches are in the GS set. However, not all midi devices will
     					support this mode.</li>
					<li><strong>GS127</strong><br/>
     					This option is for midi devices that have a MT32 patch bank installed
        				in Bank 127. Some GS implementation have this, some don't. Only use
        				this if you know that you have a MT32 implementation on Bank 127.</li>

				<para>
					Sharp occasionally releases new versions of its ROM for Zaurus. Consider a new 
					ROM like a new Linux distribution: new packages, new look, new kernel etc. It is 
					possible to update the ROM thanks to information found on the Zaurus web site 
					mentioned earlier. The current <Exult/> package for the Zaurus is created for 
					the stock SL-5500 ROM v2.12, but will work with some modifications on more recent 
					ROMs. It has been reported to work on the SL5000-D (the earlier and less capable 
					version). The package will not run of-the-shelf using the latest ROM (no matter 
					what version of the Zaurus you use) unless you make a couple of changes. More 
					detailed information on how to fix this problem will be found further down this

					you have your own method and if it works, please keep using it! To copy packages 
					on my Zaurus, I plug the cradle via USB to my Linux machine (Mandrake 10.1). 
					Inserting the Zaurus on the cradle will automatically use the usbnet module to 
					access the Zaurus via USB-over-ethernet. I then assign an IP to the net device 
					usb0. Search the net to find out how. Once the connection is done, I upload the 
					file via FTP to /mnt/cf/Documents/application/ipkg/. Then I start the add/remove

					Using the standard ROM has lead people to some issues. I recommend you install a

					and <Exult/> packages. You will also have to transfer the U7 data files to the 
					Zaurus. I chose to install the data files on my Compact Flash card (/mnt/cf/) on 
					the /mnt/cf/exult-data/si/static directory. Simply copy the content of your U7's 
					static/ dir to this dir and you'll be done. The previous example is for Serpent Isle 
					("si" as you can see in the file path). For Black Gate, you would put "bg" instead of 
					"si". Only the static dir is relevant. You can copy everything if you want to but it

			<header>Using the latest ROM</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					As mentioned earlier, <Exult/> won't run properly on the latest ROM 
					(v3.10 as of 20030801) without some changes. There are a few reason why. 
					I know they have changed the default user to be "zaurus" instead of "root", 
					which mess up the paths and the config file. Indeed, by default, <Exult/> 
					reads its config file on ~/.exult.cfg which gets expanded to /home/root/.exult.cfg 
					on the default ROM but to /home/zaurus/.exult.cfg on the newest ROM. Since 
					the package installs all user-related files to /home/root, <Exult/> won't find 
					them on the latest ROM. Not only ~/.exult.cfg is concerned, but also ~/.exult/ 
					which contains the gamedat (current runing game) and the savegames. Finally, the 
					files' owner is set to "root" so the user "zaurus" won't be able to alter files 
					and directories.

			<body>
				<para>
					In order to play, you'll have to change the location of the files installed by the 
					package to /home/zaurus/ instead of /home/root/. You'll have to type "su" to be able 
					to change it. "su" is a command to become superuser (root).<br/>
					Not only you want to move the files ~/.exult.cfg and ~/.exult/ to /home/zaurus/ but 
					you also want to edit the ~/.exult.cfg so that every occurrence of /home/root/ is 
					replaced with /home/zaurus.<br/>
					First, open a terminal (install one if you don't have one).
				</para>
				<para>
					From the terminal, verify who you are by typing ($ is the prompt):<br/>
					<kbd>$ cd ~/</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>$ whoami</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>$ pwd</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					The "whoami" command should return "zaurus". The "pwd" command should
					return "/home/zaurus/".<br/>
					Then copy the <Exult/> files:<br/>
					<kbd>$ cp /home/root/.exult* ~/ -rf</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					And change ownership to yourself. You might have to become root to do
					so:<br/>
					<kbd>$ su</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /home/zaurus/.exult* -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /opt/QtPalmtop/share/exult -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /opt/QtPalmtop/bin/exult* -R</kbd><br/>

					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /opt/QtPalmtop/apps/Games/exult.desktop -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># exit</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					The # is the root's prompt. The "exit" command will stop the "su"
					command and make you return to the "zaurus" user. It is now time to
					edit the .exult.cfg. A fast way to do it:<br/>
					<kbd>$ sed -e 's/root/zaurus/' &gt;~/.exult.cfg ~/.exult.cfg_new</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>$ mv ~/.exult.cfg_new ~/.exult.cfg</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					Normally, you should be able to start and play the game normally.
					Let me know if I am missing anything.

				<para>
					Insert Disk 1 in your floppy drive, open explorer and click on the floppy drive 
					(<strong>a:\</strong>). 
					Doubleclick on install.exe, choose the drive you want to install to, and then in which 
					folder you want BG/SI to be installed to (Let's assume <strong>C:\Exult\ULTIMA7</strong> 
					for BG and <strong>C:\Exult\SERPENT</strong> for SI).<br/> 
					Next you choose the sound card, but as this is not relevant for <Exult/>, choose "No sound 
					card". Confirm the settings with "Y" and the installer begins to make noise in your 
					floppy drive...<br/>
					When asked to insert the next floppy disk and hit any key (or ESC to cancel). When the
					installation is done, the installer will complain, that "something has put your system 
					in protected mode...", ignore that and press any key to continue. Again it will complain 
					that "your current system configuration is not compatible with Ultima VII!...", ignore 
					that as well and press "N" (you don't need a bootdisk for playing U7 with <Exult/>). Finally 
					hit any key to finish your installation. The installer will finish and the game can be 
					found at <strong>C:\Exult\ULTIMA7</strong> or <strong>C:\Exult\SERPENT</strong>.
				</para>
				<para>
					When installing Ultima VII from floppy disks in Windows you can run into some problems.<br/>
					The installer assumes that all drives in the computer are hard drives and can't cope with
					drives like CD-Roms and card readers. It tries to read how much free space the drives have 
					and if there is no media in the drive it gives an error and you can't proceed.<br/>
					To solve this you have to insert a CD-Rom in your CD/DVD-Rom drive. If you have a multi card 
					reader disconnect that if possible (or insert cards in all the slots if you have them). If 
					disconnecting the reader is not possible you have to use one of the other ways to install the
					floppy versions or use a different computer.
				</para>
				<para>
					Unfortunately it is possible that one of the floppies is no longer working. In that case the
					installation will fail and the installer might suggest that there is a device error and asks 
					you to reboot your computer. Don't follow that advice a reboot is not likely to fix it.

			<body>
				<para>
					Insert the add-on floppy disk in your floppy drive, open explorer and click on the floppy 
					drive (<strong>a:\</strong>). Doubleclick on install.exe, and then you first have to choose 
					the drive where you installed the game (BG/SI) to. Default is <strong>C:\</strong>, the 
					installer will then search in which folder BG/SI has been installed to. This is unfortunately 
					not working on every computer, for some unknown reason the installer might crash at this point.<br/>
					If it doesn't crash the installer will write where it found BG/SI installed to and will ask 
					whether you want to proceed with the installation. Hit "Y" and the installation will begin, 
					at the end press any key to finish the installation and to close the installer.
				</para>
				<para>
					When installing the add-ons you might run into the same problems as when installing the full
					games (see above <ref target="win32_floppy"/>).

					<extref target="http://dosbox.com">DOSBox</extref> is a program that emulates the old Dos
					and should run on any operating system that <Exult/> runs on (and more). So this is perfect

					To install Ultima VII with DOSBox, download and install DOSBox from 
					<extref target="http://http://dosbox.com"/>.Make a new folder in your <strong>C:\</strong> drive

					<kbd>mount a a:\ -t floppy</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>a:</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>install</kbd><br/>
				</para>
				<para>
					The installer will start and ask you on which drive to install Ultima VII to. Choose c and 
					when it asks for the target directory choose <strong>C:\ULTIMA7</strong> for BG or 
					<strong>C:\SERPENT</strong> for SI (in both cases you can just hit enter). Next you choose 
					the sound card, but as this is not relevant for <Exult/>, choose "No sound card". Confirm the 
					settings with "Y" and the installer begins to make noise in your floppy drive...<br/>

			<header>Installing the CD-ROM versions of Ultima VII</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					There are a couple of CD-ROM versions of Ultima VII. Most of these come with the add-ons pre-installed
					so with these you don't have to bother with installing the floppy disk version of the add-ons.
					To our knowledge the following CD-ROM versions exist:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>EA Compilation</strong><br/>
					This includes BG and a couple of other games (Savage Empire, Ultima Underworld and other non-Ultima games). 
					Unfortunately BG does not have the add-on FoV included. From the CD just copy the folder Ultima7 to 
					<strong>C:\Exult</strong>.</li>
					<li><strong>Ultima Collection</strong><br/>					
					From the CD just copy the folders Serpent and Ultima7 to <strong>C:\Exult</strong>. Don't bother 
					with the Ultima Collection installer. Both games come with the add-ons included.</li>
					<li><strong>The Complete Ultima VII (EA presents CD-Rom Classics)</strong><br/>
					On this CD-Rom the games are zipped in Serpent.zip and Ultima7.zip. Unzip serpent.zip to 
					<strong>C:\Exult\SERPENT</strong> and unzip Ultima7.zip to <strong>C:\Exult\ULTIMA7</strong>. 
					Both games come with the add-ons included.</li>

				<para>
					If you are following the above guide and copied the games from the 
					Ultima Collection CD you might run into a permissions problem on *nix systems, 
					including Mac OSX. You need to set group permissions to read and write.
				</para>
				<para>
					On OSX select both game folders, bring up info, go to Ownership and Permissions,
					expand details, change Access under Group from read only to read and write, then 
					click Apply.

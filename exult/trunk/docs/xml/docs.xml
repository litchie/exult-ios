			<header>What is <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But,
					being a DOS game with a very nonstandard memory manager, it is difficult
					to run it on the latest computers. <Exult/> is a project to create
					an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems, capable of
					using the data and graphics files that come with the game.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> is being developed in C++ under Linux, MacOS and Windows
					using the SDL library to make porting to other platforms relatively easy.
					The current version supports much of the game's plot, allowing you to
					talk to NPCs, use items, solve quests, and even fight monsters. Music,
					speech, and the full introduction are also implemented. This, and further
					development, is only possible due to the work done by other fans who have
					decoded the various Ultima 7 data files, especially Gary Thompson, Maxim
					Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993)
					play the game on modern hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing)
					its original splendor as is possible. You need to <strong>own</strong>
					"Ultima 7: The Black Gate" "Ultima 7: Serpent Isle" and all the add-ons (not
					required to run but we require you to own them if you use them) in order
					to use <Exult/>, and we encourage you to buy a legal copy.
				</para>

		<sub name="terms">
			<header>Terms we use in regard to Exult and Ultima 7</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					We are using many terms in this documentation, the FAQ and other documentation
					files that people may have difficulties to understand. Here we will try to give
					some explanations.
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>BG</strong>, <strong>SI</strong>, <strong>FoV</strong>
					or <strong>SS</strong>:<br/>
						we refer to "Ultima 7: The Black Gate" as BG and to "Ultima 7: Serpent Isle"
						as SI. The add-ons "Forge of Virtue" and "Silver Seed" are called FoV and SS.</li>
					<li><strong>eggs</strong>:<br/>
						these are trip-wires that cause monsters to spawn, execute scripts, play music,
						change weather, trigger traps, teleport when you get near them.</li>
					<li><strong>flex files</strong>:<br/>
						or flexes are used by the original to store the data files.
						Also when you choose not use compressed save games (see save_compression_level in
						<ref target="exult_config"/>) our save games are also "flexed".</li>
					<li><strong>gumps</strong>:<br/>
						the windows used in the game interface for containers, characters, menus, etc..</li>
					<li><strong>paperdoll</strong>:<br/>
						when pressing <key>i</key> you get the inventory display. It's the picture of your
						characters body (or the bodies of your party members) onto which you can drag all
						kinds of equipment. The way this is displayed in SI is what we call
						<strong>paperdoll</strong>. We integrated this for BG as well.
						(see <extref doc="faq" target="improvements"/>).</li>
					<li><strong>shapes</strong>:<br/>
						shape files are the format used for storage of all graphics elements (from UI buttons
						to terrain features) of the games Exult supports. Shapes may contain one or more
						frames (a frame is a single image).</li>
					<li><strong>snapshot</strong>:<br/>
						see <extref doc="faq" target="whatis_snapshot"/>.<br/>
						Please note that our documentation usually refers to the latest snapshot.</li>
					<li><strong>usecode</strong>:<br/>
						that's the scripting language that drives all of U7 (conversations, objects...).</li>
					<li><strong>Exult data directory</strong>:<br/>
						that's the directory where Exult stores its data files (exult.flx, exult_bg.flx and
						exult_si.flx).</li>
				</ul>
			</body>

	</section>
	<section title="Configurations">
		<sub name="installation">
			<header>Installation</header>
			<body>
				<ul>
					<li>First you need to get Ultima 7. Either you own it already, or
						you buy it somewhere. Then you must install it on a DOS/Windows
						machine to get the data files.<br/>
						Alternatively  you can use a PC emulator to install it.
						The <strong>Ultima Collection</strong> already contains a pre-installed
						version of U7 (in the directory /ultima7 on the CD).</li>
					<li>From the Ultima7 folder on your PC, copy the STATIC sub folder to
						an appropriate folder - see <ref target="path_config"/> what those
						could be.</li>
					<li>Now run <strong>exult</strong> (<strong>exult.exe</strong> in Windows)
						and quit it immediately.</li>
					<li>Edit the configuration file with the correct paths for the game
						folders and sfx files - see <ref target="exult_config"/></li>
					<li>Run <strong>exult</strong> and enjoy the game :-)</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					<strong>Word of advice:</strong> Don't mix the files from BG and SI.
				</para>
				<para>
					<strong>Important:</strong> Do not run <Exult/> on an original Ultima7
					game which you're actually in the middle of playing, as Exult's saved
					files have a different format. There is no way to convert those
					original save games and they will just crash <Exult/>.
				</para>
			</body>
		</sub>
		<sub name="exult_config">
			<header>Settings in exult.cfg</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> keeps a configuration file. You can specify where your Ultima 7
					installation is, whether you want full screen graphics, or windowed, and
					midi devices and midi settings. Some of these options can be set from the
					<strong>Setup</strong> menu when you run <Exult/> or via the Game Options menu.
				</para>
				<para>
					If you do not already have a configuration file, <Exult/> will make one for you
					filling in sensible defaults by itself. The location of this file varies
					slightly. On UNIX systems you can expect to find it in $HOME/.exult.cfg while
					other operating systems will probably locate it as 'exult.cfg' in the same
					directory as the <Exult/> binary. However it is recommended that you edit this
					file by hand to achieve optimal results for your system.
				</para>
				<para>
					<em>Note:</em> the settings in exult.cfg are the <strong>same</strong> on
					<strong>all</strong> operating systems (except when explicitly stated below).
				</para>
				<para>
					The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should be simple to
					understand and modify. Take care though. Handling of syntax errors in this file
					is not well tested.
				</para>
				<para>
					Okay, the default file looks like this (do not copy the **and following
					- these are my remarks).
				</para>
				<para>
					Note: yes means enabled, no means disabled

					You have two choices on how to setup <Exult/>.
				</para>
				<para>
					The first one is very easy, just extract all the files from the
					compiled snapshot archive to the directory where you have The Black
					Gate or Serpent Isle installed. Concerning the paths you don't have to
					configure anything.
				</para>
				<para>
					The other is a little more complicated but appeals to control freaks like me:<br/>
					Make a directory c:\ultima7<br/>
					make two subfolders named "blackgate" and "serpentisle" (without the quotes of course)<br/>
					Extract or install the two Ultima 7 games into the appropriate folder
					("The Black Gate" to c:\ultima7\blackgate and "Serpent Isle" to c:\ultima7\serpentisle)<br/>
					Extract the compiled <Exult/> to c:\ultima7<br/>

			<body>
				<para>
					There are two ways that music is played in Exult. One is using MIDI, which plays the
					music through any GM MIDI device, Timidity can be used in Linux.  The other is
					Digital Music encoded into OGG (similar to MP3) which was recorded directly from a
					Roland MT-32.<br/>
					The MIDI files are converted on-the-fly from the original Ultima 7
					MT-32 files to General Midi format so that they will be playable on modern General
					Midi and General Midi/GS supporting sound cards.
				</para>
				<para>
					The options for changing the Music format are in the opening Exult menu Setup screen
					or in the actual game's audio options.
					The following settings can be used (in order of music conversion quality):
				</para>
				<ul>
      				<li><strong>Digital</strong><br/>
        				Digital Music plays the OGG files which must be located in the Exult data/music
        				directory. This does not use MIDI but plays the music digitally through
        				any soundcard.</li>
      				<li><strong>fmsynth</strong><br/>
      					This is a Software FM Synthesizer (also known as a emulated Opl2/Adlib). It has
      					a 'dual'mode for stereo sound. Use "config/audio/midi/dual_opl" set to "yes" or "no"
      					to enable/disable it. Default is "yes".<br/>
      					<strong>You have to restart Exult if you change this in the game.</strong></li>
      				<li><strong>none</strong><br/>
        				This option will output the music with nothing changed. Because
               			the mapping will be for MT32s you should only use this option if
               			you have a MT32 compatible device or you have replaced the
               			music.</li>
      				<li><strong>gs127</strong><br/>
     					This option is for midi devices that have a MT32 patch bank installed
        				in Bank 127. Some GS implementation have this, some don't. Only use
        				this if you know that you have a MT32 implementation on Bank 127.</li>
     				<li><strong>gs</strong><br/>
     					This will convert the MT32 patches to their equivalent GS patches. This
     					will be a more accurate conversion that straight gm since more of the
     					MT32 patches are in the GS set. However, not all midi devices will
     					support this mode.</li>
					<li><strong>gm</strong><br/>
						This will convert the MT32 patches to standard General Midi patches.
     					Conversion is fairly accurate but some instruments may be different.</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					The order of music conversion quality is:
				</para>
				<para>
					<strong>NOTE:</strong> Currently the conversion to GS and GS127 is not finished and
					the notes are only mapped to General Midi.

					Due to the way the class was constructed input can be in either .mid, .rmi or

					have correct XMIDI headers.
				</para>
				<para>
					During the development of the XMIDI class it was found that certain .xmi files

			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> needs the Digital Music pack to play Digital Music in the game. The music
					pack contains music for both Black Gate and Serpent Isle, encoded in high quality
					OGG format. Simon Quinn recorded the current Digital Music pack on an original
					Roland MT-32 and with this you will experience the music as it would be heard with
					the original game.<br/>
					The Digital Music pack can be downloaded from
					<extref target="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php"/>, the files are called
					U7MusicOGG_1of2.zip and U7MusicOGG_2of2.zip.  Instructions of how to install these
					files are in the ZIP files themselves (they need to be extracted into the
					Exult/data/music directory).<br/>
					Digital Music should work on any platform that supports digital sound and does not
					use any MIDI, so it is also a good option for platforms with no MIDI support.
					Additionally, Digital Music supports a number of background atmospheric SFX tracks
					that are played when no music is playing. These consist of wind, bird etc effects
					outside and other sound effects when inside a dungeon. These SFX tracks are not
					available when using MIDI as they play Roland MT-32 specific voices that cannot
					be mapped to GM/GS. These SFX tracks do not play when the music is switched off.

					You have to download separate packs for each game as order of the sfx in BG

					issue with sfx playback in SI: In combat the sfx may be a little wrong as we
					still haven't figured out all the data in the 'weapons.dat'.<br/>
					Also <Exult/> doesn't yet playback all the sfx that the original did.
				</para>

					<li><strong>Difficulty</strong><br/>
						Ranges from Easiest (-3) to Hardest (3). It affects the chance of a hit, and

						With this enabled you can see the hitpoints of NPCs in brackets after their name when
						you left-click on them.</li>
					<li><strong>Mode</strong><br/>
						choose between Original and SpacePauses. SpacePauses gives you a little more control of
						combat. When you hit space the game pauses and you can direct a party member by

					Introduced in April 2002, this PDA is really a pico-computer (one
					degree of magnitude less than micro). It runs a version of Linux on
					the ARM processor. It is possible to use cross-compilers to create
					programs that will run on the Zaurus, even if compiling from a x86
					machine. This is notably the case for the Zaurus port of Exult. More
					information about the Zaurus can be gleaned on

					Sharp occasionnally releases new versions of its ROM for
					Zaurus. Consider a new ROM like a new Linux distribution: new
					packages, new look, new kernel etc. It is possible to update the ROM
					thanks to information found on the Zaurus web site mentioned earlier.
					The current exult package for the Zaurus is created for the stock
					SL-5500 ROM v2.12. It has been reported to work on the SL5000-D (the
					earlier and less capable version). However, it has been reported that
					the package will not run properly using the latest ROM (no matter what
					version of the Zaurus you use). More detailed information on how to
					fix this problem will be found further down this document.

					Exult uses SDL for multimedia access to the computer (music and video
					in particular). In order to play Exult on your Zaurus, you need to
					install the SDL library as well as the SDL-mixer library. Do not use
					the stock versions found on <extref target="http://www.libsdl.org"/>.
					Rather, use thespecially prepared versions for Zaurus found on
					<extref target="http://www.gnurou.org"/>. These versions support more

			<header>Installing new packages</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					The first step to install a new package is to have the package
					downloaded and accessible from your Zaurus. I use a method I am
					comfortable with. If you have your own method and if it works, please
					keep using it! To copy packages on my Zaurus, I plug the cradle via
					USB to my Linux machine (Mandrake 8.2). I've changed the
					modules.usbmap file so that inserting the Zaurus on the cradle will
					automatically use the usbdnet module to access the Zaurus via
					USB-over-ethernet. Search the net to find out how. Once the
					connection is done, I upload the file via FTP to
					/mnt/cf/Documents/application/ipkg/. Then I start the add/remove
					package, select add new package and choose the file I just uploaded.

			<body>
				<para>
					If like me you still use the standard ROM, simply install the SDL,
					SDL-mixer and Exult packages. You will also have to transfer the U7
					data files to the Zaurus. I chose to install the data files on my
					Compact Flash card (/mnt/cf/) on the /mnt/cf/exult-data/si/static
					directory. Simply copy the content of your U7's static/ dir to this
					dir and you'll be done. The previous example is for Serpent Isle ("si"
					as you can see in the file path). For Black Gate, you would put "bg"
					instead of "si". Only the static dir is relevant. You can copy
					everything if you want to but it will space for nothing.

					Two additional packages exist and are not required. They hold the new

		<sub name="latest_rom">
			<header>Using the latest ROM</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					As mentioned earlier, Exult won't run properly on the latest ROM
					(v3.10 as of 20030801). There are a few reason why. First, since I
					haven't installed this ROM, I cannot test it. Then, I know they have
					changed the default user to be "zaurus" instead of "root", which mess
					up the paths and the config file. Indeed, by default, Exult reads its
					config file on ~/.exult.cfg which gets expanded to
					/home/root/.exult.cfg on the default ROM but to
					/home/zaurus/.exult.cfg on the newest ROM. Since the package installs
					all user-related files to /home/root, Exult won't find them on the
					latest ROM. Not only ~/.exult.cfg is concerned, but also ~/.exult/
					which contains the gamedat (current runing game) and the
					savegames. Finally, the files' owner is set to "root" so the user
					"zaurus" won't be able to alter files and directories.
				</para>
			</body>

		<sub name="solve_rom_problem">
			<header>Solving the problems with the latest ROM</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					In order to play, you'll have to change the location of the files
					installed by the package to /home/zaurus/ instead of /home/root/. I
					have not done this, but I expect you'd have to "su" to be able to
					change it. "su" is a command to become superuser (root).<br/>
					Not only you want to move the files ~/.exult.cfg and ~/.exult/ to
					/home/zaurus/ but you also want to edit the ~/.exult.cfg so that every
					occurence of /home/root/ is replaced with /home/zaurus.<br/>
					Please remember I have not done nor tested this, but here are the
					commands I suppose you'd have to type. First, open a terminal (install
					one if you don't have one).
				</para>
				<para>
					From the terminal, verify who you are by typing ($ is the prompt):<br/>
					<kbd>$ cd ~/</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>$ whoami</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>$ pwd</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					The "whoami" command should return "zaurus". The "pwd" command should
					return "/home/zaurus/".<br/>
					Then copy the exult files:<br/>
					<kbd>$ cp /home/root/.exult* ~/ -rf</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					And change ownership to yourself. You might have to become root to do
					so:<br/>
					<kbd>$ su</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /home/zaurus/.exult* -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /opt/QtPalmtop/share/exult -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /opt/QtPalmtop/bin/exult* -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /opt/QtPalmtop/pics/exult.png -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># chown zaurus:zaurus /opt/QtPalmtop/apps/Games/exult.desktop -R</kbd><br/>
					<kbd># exit</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					The # is the root's prompt. The "exit" command will stop the "su"
					command and make you return to the "zaurus" user. It is now time to
					edit the .exult.cfg. A fast way to do it:<br/>
					<kbd>$ sed -e 's/root/zaurus/' ~/.exult.cfg ~/.exult.cfg_new</kbd><br/>
					<kbd>$ mv ~/.exult.cfg_new ~/.exult.cfg</kbd>
				</para>
				<para>
					Normally, you should be able to start and play the game normally.
					Let me know if I am missing anything.

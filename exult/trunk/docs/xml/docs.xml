			<header>What is <Exult/>?</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But,
					being a DOS game with a very nonstandard memory manager, it is difficult
					to run it on the latest computers. <Exult/> is a project to create
					an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems, capable of
					using the data and graphics files that come with the game.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> is being developed in C++ under Linux, MacOS and Windows
					using the SDL library to make porting to other platforms relatively easy.
					The current version supports much of the game's plot, allowing you to
					talk to NPCs, use items, solve quests, and even fight monsters. Music,
					speech, and the full introduction are also implemented. This, and further
					development, is only possible due to the work done by other fans who have
					decoded the various Ultima 7 data files, especially Gary Thompson, Maxim
					Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993)
					play the game on modern hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing)
					its original splendor as is possible. You need to <strong>own</strong>
					"Ultima 7: The Black Gate" in order to use <Exult/>, and we encourage
					you to buy a legal copy.
				</para>

			<header>Installation</header>
			<body>
				<ul>
					<li>First you need to get Ultima 7. Either you own it already, or
						you buy it somewhere. Then you must install it on a DOS/Windows
						machine to get the data files.<br/>
						Alternatively  you can use a PC emulator to install it. 
						The <strong>Ultima Collection</strong> already contains a pre-installed
						version of U7 (in the directory /ultima7 on the CD).</li>
					<li>From the Ultima7 folder on your PC, copy the STATIC sub folder to 
						an appropriate folder - see <ref target="path_config"/> what those 
						could be.</li>
					<li>Now run <strong>exult</strong> (<strong>exult.exe</strong> in Windows)
						and quit it immediately.</li>
					<li>Edit the configuration file with the correct paths for the game 
						folders and sfx files - see <ref target="exult_config"/></li>
					<li>Run <strong>exult</strong> and enjoy the game :-)</li>
				</ul>
				<para>
					<strong>Word of advice:</strong> Don't mix the files from BG and SI.
				</para>
				<para>
					<strong>Important:</strong> Do not run <Exult/> on an original Ultima7
					game which you're actually in the middle of playing, as Exult's saved
					files have a different format. There is no way to convert those 
					original savegames and they will just crash <Exult/>.
				</para>
			</body>

		<sub name="exult_config">
			<header>Settings in exult.cfg</header>
			<body>
				<para>
					<Exult/> keeps a configuration file. You can specify where your Ultima 7
					installation is, whether you want fullscreen graphics, or windowed, and
					midi devices and midi settings. Some of these options can be set from the
					<strong>Setup</strong> menu when you run <Exult/> or via the Game menu.
				</para>
				<para>
					If you do not already have a configuration file, <Exult/> will make one for you
					filling in sensible defaults by itself. The location of this file varies 
					slightly. On UNIX systems you can expect to find it in $HOME/.exult.cfg while 
					other operating systems will probably locate it as 'exult.cfg' in the same 
					directory as the <Exult/> binary. However it is recommended that you edit this 
					file by hand to achieve optimal results for your system.
				</para>
				<para>
					The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should be simple to
					understand and modify. Take care though. Handling of syntax errors in this file
					is not well tested.
				</para>
				<para>
					Okay, the default file looks like this (do not copy the **and following
					- these are my remarks).

				<para>
					You have two choices on how to setup <Exult/>.
				</para>
				<para>
					The first one is very easy, just extract all the files from the
					compiled snapshot archive to the directory where you have The Black
					Gate or Serpent Isle installed. Concerning the paths you don't have to
					configure anything.
				</para>
				<para>
					The other is a little more complicated but appeals to control freaks like me:<br/>
					Make a directory c:\ultima7<br/>
					make two subfolders named "blackgate" and "serpentisle" (without the quotes of course)<br/>
					Extract or install the two Ultima 7 games into the appropriate folder
					("The Black Gate" to c:\ultima7\blackgate and "Serpent Isle" to c:\ultima7\serpentisle)<br/>
					Extract the compiled <Exult/> to c:\ultima7<br/>
					Now you have to edit the exult.cfg file like this:

					Midi in <Exult/> is played by firstly loading a file and passing it to the XMIDI
					class for instrument mapping conversion. This is so the MT32 mapped music files
					from the original Ultima 7 and Serpent Isle will be playable on modern General
					Midi and General Midi/GS supporting sound cards.
					You can change the way the music sounds via the setup or ingame menu or the 
					exult.cfg file.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> gives users various option for converting Music and Midi Sound Effects.
					Currently the only way to set the options is via manually editing the config
					file. Note, the options are case sensitive and all options must be lowercase.<br/>
					Below is a description of all the modes:
				</para>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>gm</strong><br/>
						This will convert the MT32 patches to standard General Midi patches.
     					Conversion is fairly accurate but some instruments may be different.</li>
     				<li><strong>gs</strong><br/>
     					This will convert the MT32 patches to their equivalent GS patches. This
     					will be a more accurate conversion that straight gm since more of the 
     					MT32 patches are in the GS set. However, not all midi devices will
     					support this mode.</li>
     				<li><strong>gs127</strong><br/>
     					This option is for midi devices that have a MT32 patch bank installed
        				in Bank 127. Some GS implementation have this, some don't. Only use
        				this if you know that you have a MT32 implementation on Bank 127.</li>
        			<li><strong>none</strong><br/>
        				This option will output the music with nothing changed. Because
               			the mapping will be for MT32s you should only use this option if
               			you have a MT32 compatible device or you have replaced the
               			music.</li>
				</ul>

					<li><strong>gs127</strong></li>
					<li><strong>gs</strong></li>

					Due to the way the class was constructed input can be in either .mid, .rmi or

				<para>
					<Exult/> needs the so called sfx packs to enable sound effects for Ultima 7.
					You have to download separate packs for each game as order of the sfx in BG 
					and SI varies a bit and otherwise will sound odd. However there is a little 
					issue with sfx playback in SI: In combat the sfx may be a little wrong as we 
					still haven't figured out all the data in the 'weapons.dat'.<br/>
					Also <Exult/> doesn't yet playback all the sfx that the orignal did.

					Note that configuring your soundfonts is not needed for digital wave sfx.

					<extref target="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/exult/jmsfxsi.zip"/> (~6.01 MB) 
					for "Serpent Isle".<br/>
					J.Morris recorded the original sfx used in BG and SI which meant a lot of work. Don't

				<para>	
					By default <Exult/> runs at 320x200 (which is the resolution the original
					Ultima VII used). <Exult/> can use different scaling engines to
					double the size to 640x400 and increase the quality of the graphics.
				</para>
				<para>
					Using higher resolutions is considered cheating as you can see too much of
					the surrounding area. Since the game was designed to be played at a specific
					size, this can actually lead to plot-stopping problems; hence we will not fix 
					any problem caused by your cheating! Don't say we didn't warn you :-)<br/>
					Actually being able to play in higher resolutions is one of the big advantages 
					of <Exult/> but as mentioned above it comes with a price.
				</para>

					Within the game you can use the <key>Alt +</key> and <key>Alt -</key>

			<question>What is <Exult/>?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>

				Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But,

				being a DOS game with a very non-standard memory manager, it is difficult

				to run it on the latest computers. <Exult/> is a project to create

				an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems, capable of

				using the data and graphics files that come with the game.

				</para>

				<para>

				<Exult/> is being developed in C++ under Linux, MacOS and Windows

				using the SDL library to make porting to other platforms relatively easy.

				The current version supports much of the game's plot, allowing you to

				talk to NPCs, use items, solve quests, and even fight monsters. Music,

				speech, and the full introduction are also implemented. This, and further

				development, is only possible due to the work done by other fans who have

				decoded the various Ultima 7 data files, especially Gary Thompson, Maxim

				Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag.

				</para>

				<para>

				<Exult/> aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993)

				play the game on modern hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing)

				its original splendor as is possible. You need to <strong>own</strong>

				"Ultima 7: The Black Gate" in order to use <Exult/>, and we encourage

				you to buy a legal copy.

				</para>

			</answer>

		</faq>

		<faq name="why_name_exult">

			<question>Why is it called <Exult/> - what is the meaning of this name?</question>

			<answer>

				<cite name="Jeff wrote on the Boards">

					I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where

					the 'X' comes from. The "ult", of course, comes from Ultima. It

					was only about 6 months ago that I replaced the X code with SDL,

					which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to

					BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder

					to maintain that way.

				</cite>

				<cite name="Ibrahim Holtzmann">

					I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that

					means "to rejoice, to exhibit great happiness".

		<faq name="is_exult_free">

			<question>Is <Exult/> free ?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>
				
				<Exult/> is more than free: it's Free (notice the caps). <Exult/> is released
				
				under the GNU GPL (General Public License). This means that the source code
				
				for <Exult/> is freely available and you can do whatever you want with it.
				
				However, if you make modifications to any of <Exult/>'s components and publicly
				
				redistribute your work you are required to make the source freely available
				
				in turn. Obviously the <Exult/> team would be very grateful if any
				
				modifications you make are contributed back to the main code, so that
				
				everyone can benefit from them. If you want to work on <Exult/> just send an
				
				e-mail to the <extref target="mailto:exult-general@lists.sourceforge.net">team</extref>.<br/>

		<faq name="u7_needed">

			<question>Do I need Ultima 7?</question>
			
			<answer>
				
				<para>
				
				Yes. <Exult/> won't work without the original files.
				
				</para>
				
			</answer>

		</faq>

		<faq name="u7_versions">

			<question>Does <Exult/> work on all versions of the game?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>

				It seems to run most of the available versions of the game. The most common

				one nowadays with added "Forge of Virtue" runs for sure.

				</para>

				<para>

				However there are reported problems with the localized versions of the

				game (French, German and Spanish). Conversation threads don't seem to skip to the

				next line in the proper places and therefore are unreadable in some cases. SI
				
				was only published in English so no localization problems with that.

				</para>

				<para>

				V0.91 Alpha2 adds fixes for the french version, which should work now.

				No work has been done for the german version, due to lack of testers. If

				you have the German or Spanish version, and want it to run, contact us.

				</para>

		<faq name="si_support">

			<question>How about Serpent Isle?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>

				The team is working on it. It is not yet fully playable but you can walk around,

				talk to some people, finish some quests... Plotwise you will

				get quite far but you certainly won't be able to play through it yet.

				</para>
				
				<para>
				
				Old quotes on this topic from the time when SI wasn't playable at all in <Exult/>.
				
				</para>

				<cite name="Colourless">

					I can't say much about the what will happen except that a completely

					working Serpent Isle will be an annoying task to complete. It is

					close to BG in some ways, but very different in others. 

				</cite>

				<cite name="Jeff">

					My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all

					the work so far on it. I'd much prefer to add enhancements to BG

					(which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG.

					Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals,

					that would change things. And also, since <Exult/> is open-source,

					it would be fine if anyone wants to volunteer to work on SI.

		</faq>

		<faq name="addon_support">

			<question>Do the Add-Ons work?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>

				"Forge of Virtue" (Add-On to Black Gate) is supported. Even though SI

				is not yet fully running the same holds true for "The Silver Seed".

		<faq name="play_through_u7">

			<question>Can you play through U7 yet?</question>

				SI is partially playable since V0.91 Alpha2.

		<faq name="old_savegames">
		
			<question>Do savegames from the original work in <Exult/>?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>

				Savegames that were made with the original Ultima 7 or U7Run don't work
				
				with <Exult/>. You have to start a new game when you begin playing with <Exult/>.
				
				Sorry!

		<faq name="u7_download">

			<question>Where do I find Ultima 7 on the net to download?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>

				<em>Don't!</em> You may be able to find it on the net but it would be

				pirating the game and the <Exult/> team doesn't support pirates. Look for

				the Ultima Collection in stores or on Ebay (<extref target="http://www.ebay.com"/>).

		<faq name="exult_config">

			<question>What is it with the exult.cfg file?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>

					Most of the switches in the exult.cfg file are now handled via

					"Setup" when you start up <Exult/>. For further understanding

					read the following descriptions.

				</para>

				<cite name="From the ReadMe">

					The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should

					be simple to understand and modify. Take care though. Handling of

					syntax errors in this file is not well tested. <Exult/> will create

					this file for you, with some sensible defaults, and you can then

					edit it to suit your preferences.

					okay, the default file looks like this (do not copy the **and following

			<question>What do I have to change in the Path-Settings?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>You have two choices on how to setup <Exult/>.</para>

				<para>

					The first one is very easy, just extract all the files from the

					compiled snapshot archive to the directory where you have The Black

					Gate or Serpent Isle installed. Concerning the paths you don't have to

					configure anything.

				</para>

				<para>

					The other is a little more complicated but appeals to control freaks like me:<br/>

					Make a directory c:\ultima7<br/>

					make two subfolders named "blackgate" and "serpentisle" (without the quotes of course)<br/>

					Extract or install the two Ultima 7 games into the appropiate folder

					("The Black Gate" to c:\ultima7\blackgate and "Serpent Isle" to c:\ultima7\serpentisle)<br/>

					Extract the compiled <Exult/> to c:\ultima7<br/>

					Now you have to edit the exult.cfg file like this:

		<faq name="sound_available">

			<question>Do music and sound effects play?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>

				Yes. Music plays via MIDI and sounds quite like the original. Sound

				effects either play via digital (.wav) sfx  or also via MIDI. Even speech is supported.<br/>

				You can change the way the music and the sound effects play via the

				setup menu or the exult.cfg file.

		<faq name="sound_horrible">

			<question>The sound effects sound horrible</question>

			<answer>

				<para>

					Well the music plays okay but the sound effects sound horrible,

					especially when opening a door. What's up?

				</para>

				<para>

					This is due to the fact that the sfx is played using MIDI. For that to

					work properly you need the proper soundfont selected for your card.

					Not every soundcard supports soundfont-managing. Creative's AWE and Live!
					
					series do support it.<br/>
					
					If your card doesn't or you want to hear better sfx you are much better off 
					
					when you select wave sfx. The next section <ref target="wave_sfx"/> covers that!<br/>
					
					If you have on of those cards that do allow soundfont-managing this is how you
					
					should get some decent sound out of it (description only for Win32):

				</para>

				<ol>

					<li>

						Load up the Control Panel, select "Multimedia Properties"

						(or "Sounds and Multimedia"). Make sure that the MIDI playback

						device is the right one. For the SB Live! it has to be

						"SB Live! MIDI Synth". Don't choose "Microsoft Synth" or similar.

					</li>

					<li>

				<para>
				
				You have to set a path to the sfx pack in the waves settings in exult.cfg (see <ref target="exult_config"/>).
				
				If you leave this blank the sfx will be played through MIDI. You have to download
				
				seperate packs for each game as order of the sfx in BG and SI varies a bit and 
				
				otherwise will sound odd. However there is a little issue with sfx playback in SI (see <ref target="known_issues"/>).

			<question>What does the Scale option mean?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>

					By default <Exult/> runs at 320x200 (which is the resolution the original

					Ultima VII used). <Exult/> uses different scaling engines to

					double the size to 640x400 and increase the quality of the graphics.

					More information on the excellent scaling engine by Derek Liauw is available at

					<extref target="http://members.xoom.com/derek_liauw/"/>.

					The scalers also work with higher resolutions. To change the scaling method either

					use the <Exult/> menu or change your exult.cfg - see <ref target="exult_config"/>.
					
					"2xSaI" is the new scaler, "bilinear" is the old one, "point" duplicates the pixels,
					
					"interlaced" is the same as "point" except misses every other line, "SuperEagle" is
					
					another scaler by Derek (the author of 2xSaI). Try them out to see how they look and which
					
					you like best.

			<question>Is <Exult/> case sensitive?</question>

			<answer>

				<para>
				
				Case sensitiveness is a slight problem with <Exult/> when you are 
				
				not using the Windows port.
				
				<Exult/> tries lower and uppercase versions, and reports the error after 
				
				trying the last (ie. uppercase) filename. If the "static" directory and 
				
				the files within are uppercase you might run into problems. Better make 
				
				sure that all these are lowercase. When unzipping the Ultima files from 
				
				a zip in Linux you can set it to extract in lowercase with the "-L" switch 
				
			    (e.g. 'unzip -L ultima7.zip').
			    
			    In the lates snapshots this should be fixed.

				run out of disc space before you run out of savegame slots), shows a screenshot of
				
				the location you saved at, the members of your party, your stats, game time and the 
				
				date you actually saved. The game menu is opened via <key>Esc</key> and the save
				
				game box is opened either via the game menu or the <key>s</key> key.

				To get an Ultima 7 that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible there
				
				are several things to do (though I wonder why you'd want to do that):

				<li>make custom keybindings files (see <ref target="exult_keys"/>) in which you disable 
				
				all the keys that were not in the original for Black Gate and Serpents Isle. 
				
				In snapshots dated 29.04.2001 or later you have to assign <key>s</key> to old_file_gump
				
				to enable the old savegame menu (the line in your custom keybindings file should look like:
				
				S old_file_gump)</li>
				
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys.</li>
				
				<li>Don't set the path to the Serpent Isle files (see <ref target="path_config"/>) and put
				
				SI and a second copy of <Exult/> in a seperate directory (note: you can no longer launch both 
				
				BG and SI from the same exult.exe). This disables SI paperdolls in BG.</li>
				
				<li>Alternatively you can leave the cheat menu binding in the keybindings file (<key>F2</key>) 
				
				and disable "Paperdolls" each time you run <Exult/>.</li>
				
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and disable scalers.</li>
				
				<li>The disc icon in the Avatar paperdoll opens the new game menu. As of now this cannot be altered.

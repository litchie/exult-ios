			<question>What is <Exult/>?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But,
					being a DOS game with a very non-standard memory manager, it is difficult
					to run it on the latest computers. <Exult/> is a project to create
					an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems, capable of
					using the data and graphics files that come with the game.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> is being developed in C++ under Linux, MacOS and Windows
					using the SDL library to make porting to other platforms relatively easy.
					The current version supports much of the game's plot, allowing you to
					talk to NPCs, use items, solve quests, and even fight monsters. Music,
					speech, and the full introduction are also implemented. This, and further
					development, is only possible due to the work done by other fans who have
					decoded the various Ultima 7 data files, especially Gary Thompson, Maxim
					Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag.
				</para>
				<para>
					<Exult/> aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993)
					play the game on modern hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing)
					its original splendor as is possible. You need to <strong>own</strong>
					"Ultima 7: The Black Gate" in order to use <Exult/>, and we encourage
					you to buy a legal copy.
				</para>
			</answer>
		</faq>
		<faq name="why_name_exult">
			<question>Why is it called <Exult/> - what is the meaning of this name?</question>
			<answer>
				<cite name="Jeff wrote on the Boards">
					I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where
					the 'X' comes from. The "ult", of course, comes from Ultima. It
					was only about 6 months ago [02/29/2000] that I replaced the X code with SDL,
					which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to
					BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder
					to maintain that way.
				</cite>
				<cite name="Ibrahim Holtzmann">
					I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that
					means "to rejoice, to exhibit great happiness".

		</faq>
		<faq name="is_exult_free">
			<question>Is <Exult/> free ?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					<Exult/> is more than free: it's Free (notice the caps). <Exult/> is released
					under the GNU GPL (General Public License). This means that the source code
					for <Exult/> is freely available and you can do whatever you want with it.
					However, if you make modifications to any of <Exult/>'s components and publicly
					redistribute your work you are required to make the source freely available
					in turn. Obviously the <Exult/> team would be very grateful if any
					modifications you make are contributed back to the main code, so that
					everyone can benefit from them. If you want to work on <Exult/> just send an
					e-mail to the 
					<extref target="mailto:exult-general@lists.sourceforge.net">team</extref>.<br/>
 					More information on the GNU GPL at 
 					<extref target="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html"/>.

		</faq>
		<faq name="origin_exult">
			<question>Does Origin support <Exult/>?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					First of all, Origin has been owned by EA for a long time now and from recent 
					developements it seems that Origin only exists now to maintain Ultima Online. 
					Furthermore, Origin and/or people that worked for Origin claim that the source 
					code for Ultima 7 (BG/SI) has been lost for some time.
					So there is no chance for the <Exult/> team to have a look at the actual code.
				</para>
				<para>
					Also the team tried to contact some people from Origin earlier but got no positive
					or negative response on the <Exult/> project. So far it seems that both Origin and 
					EA have decided to ignore <Exult/>.
				</para>
			</answer>
		</faq>
		<faq name="other_ultimas">
			<question>Will <Exult/> support other Ultimas?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					<Exult/> supports only Ultima 7 (BG/SI and the add-ons). It will never support
					any other Ultima nor do members of the team plan to develop something similar.
					The reasons for this are that no other Ultima is similar to Ultima 7 in the 
					internal workings and also the team is quite sick of reverse engineering a game
					allready.

		<faq name="whatis_snapshot">
			<question>What is a snapshot? Are these screen shots or what?</question>
			<answer>

					The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It is updated almost
					daily, sometimes twice a day. There is information on how to build your
					own binary of the source but there is also the newest pre-compiled Windows binary.

		<faq name="u7_needed">
			<question>Do I need Ultima 7?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					Yes. <Exult/> won't work without the original files.
				</para>
			</answer>
		</faq>
		<faq name="u7_versions">
			<question>Does <Exult/> work on all versions of the game?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					It seems to run most of the available versions of the game. The most common
					ones nowadays with the included Add-Ons (Forge of Virtue and Silver Seed) 
					runs for sure.
				</para>
				<para>
					However there are reported problems with the localized versions of the
					game (French, German and Spanish). Conversation threads don't seem to skip to the
					next line in the proper places and therefore are unreadable in some cases. SI
					was only published in English so no localization problems with that one.
				</para>
				<para>
					V0.91 Alpha2 adds fixes for the french version, which should work now.
					No work has been done for the german version, due to lack of testers. If
					you have the German or Spanish version, and want it to run, contact us.

		<faq name="si_support">
			<question>How about Serpent Isle?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					The team is working on it. It is not yet fully playable but you can walk around,
					talk to some people, finish some quests... Plotwise you will
					get quite far but you certainly won't be able to play through it yet.
				</para>
				<para>
					Old quotes on this topic from the time when SI wasn't playable at all in <Exult/>.
				</para>
				<cite name="Colourless">
					I can't say much about the what will happen except that a completely
					working Serpent Isle will be an annoying task to complete. It is
					close to BG in some ways, but very different in others. 
				</cite>
				<cite name="Jeff">
					My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all
					the work so far on it. I'd much prefer to add enhancements to BG
					(which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG.
					Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals,
					that would change things. And also, since Exult is open-source,
					it would be fine if anyone wants to volunteer to work on SI.

		</faq>
		<faq name="addon_support">
			<question>Do the Add-Ons work?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					"Forge of Virtue" (Add-On to Black Gate) is supported. Even though SI

			<question>Do savegames from the original work in <Exult/>?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					Savegames that were made with the original Ultima 7 or U7Run don't work

					Sorry!

		<faq name="u7_download">
			<question>Where do I find Ultima 7 on the net to download?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					<em>Don't!</em> You may be able to find it on the net but it would be
					pirating the game and the <Exult/> team doesn't support pirates. Look for
					the Ultima Collection in stores or on Ebay (<extref target="http://www.ebay.com"/>).

		<faq name="exult_config">
			<question>What is it with the exult.cfg file?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					Most of the switches in the exult.cfg file are now handled via
					"Setup" when you start up <Exult/>. For further understanding
					read the following descriptions.
				</para>
				<cite name="From the ReadMe">
					The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should
					be simple to understand and modify. Take care though. Handling of
					syntax errors in this file is not well tested. Exult will create
					this file for you, with some sensible defaults, and you can then
					edit it to suit your preferences.

					Okay, the default file looks like this (do not copy the **and following

			<question>What do I have to change in the Path-Settings?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					You have two choices on how to setup <Exult/>.
				</para>
				<para>
					The first one is very easy, just extract all the files from the
					compiled snapshot archive to the directory where you have The Black
					Gate or Serpent Isle installed. Concerning the paths you don't have to
					configure anything.
				</para>
				<para>
					The other is a little more complicated but appeals to control freaks like me:<br/>
					Make a directory c:\ultima7<br/>
					make two subfolders named "blackgate" and "serpentisle" (without the quotes of course)<br/>
					Extract or install the two Ultima 7 games into the appropiate folder
					("The Black Gate" to c:\ultima7\blackgate and "Serpent Isle" to c:\ultima7\serpentisle)<br/>
					Extract the compiled <Exult/> to c:\ultima7<br/>
					Now you have to edit the exult.cfg file like this:

			<question>How do I enable <Exult/> to play digital wave sfx?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					You have to set a path to the sfx pack in the waves settings in exult.cfg 
					(see <ref target="exult_config"/>). You have to download seperate packs for 
					each game as order of the sfx in BG and SI varies a bit and otherwise will 
					sound odd. However there is a little issue with sfx playback in SI 
					(see <ref target="known_issues"/>).
				</para>
				<para>
					Note that configuring your soundfonts is not needed for digital wave sfx.
				</para>
				<para> 
					The sfx pack made by Joseph Morris can be found at 
					<extref target="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/exult/jmsfx.zip"/> (~4.55 MB) 
					for "The Black Gate" and 
					<extref target="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/exult/jmsfxsi.zip"/> (~6.01 MB) 
					for "Serpent Isle".
					He recorded the original 114 sfx used in Black Gate which must
					have been a lot of work. If your soundcard doesn't support soundfonts
					this pack is a "must-have". Enjoy!

		<faq name="scaler">
			<question>What does the Scale option mean?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					By default <Exult/> runs at 320x200 (which is the resolution the original
					Ultima VII used). <Exult/> uses different scaling engines to
					double the size to 640x400 and increase the quality of the graphics.
					More information on the excellent scaling engine by Derek Liauw is available at
					<extref target="http://members.xoom.com/derek_liauw/"/>.
					The scalers also work with higher resolutions. To change the scaling method either
					use the <Exult/> menu or change your exult.cfg - see <ref target="exult_config"/>.
					"2xSaI" is the new scaler, "bilinear" is the old one, "point" duplicates the pixels,
					"interlaced" is the same as "point" except misses every other line, "SuperEagle" is
					another scaler by Derek (the author of 2xSaI). Try them out to see how they look 
					and which you like best.
				</para>

					Your screen should be set to 16-bit color mode.

					Within the game you can use the <key>Alt +</key> and <key>Alt -</key>

					selected mode and reuse it the next time you run <Exult/>.

		<faq name="case_sensitiveness">
			<question>Is <Exult/> case sensitive?</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					Case sensitiveness is a slight problem with <Exult/> when you are 
					not using the Windows port.
					<Exult/> tries lower and uppercase versions, and reports the error after 
					trying the last (ie. uppercase) filename. If the "static" directory and 
					the files within are uppercase you might run into problems. Better make 
					sure that all these are lowercase. When unzipping the Ultima files from 
					a zip in Linux you can set it to extract in lowercase with the "-L" switch 
			    	(e.g. 'unzip -L ultima7.zip').
			    	This is fixed in the latest release.

		<faq name="exult_keys">
			<question>What are the keys used in <Exult/>?</question>

				<para>
					Starting with V0.91 Alpha2 all key commands can be changed. However, there
					is a default setting which closely follows the original with the addition of
					some improvements.
				</para>
				<para>
					To change your key bindings first edit the file defaultkeys.txt in your <Exult/> 
					directory, change the bindings and save the file (e.g. as my_keys.txt). Now you

				Serpent Isle had many more improvements over Black Gate (keyring,

			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					Right now the main goal is to get the Black Gate 100% working. After
					that it could be that some more things will be improved as far as it
					is possible to implement these.
				</para>
				<para>
					The keyring is not in Black Gate but there is the <key>k</key> key

				</para>
				<para>
					Recently Ryan added paperdoll support in Black Gate. Though it is
					still buggy (some items disappear to Neverneverland) it is beautiful
					to look at. Very impressive. For this you need to have Serpent Isle
					installed on your hard drive and you must set the path to it in exult.cfg
					(see <ref target="path_config"/>). If an item seems to have disappeared
					press <key>F2</key> to activate the cheat menu and disable Paperdolls. Now

				<para>
					Since the Alpha 4 release a new game menu was added with an
					improved sound settings box and a very much improved (<strong>awesome</strong>)
					savegame box. This allows you much more savegames than the original (you should
					run out of disc space before you run out of savegame slots), shows a screenshot of
					the location you saved at, the members of your party, your stats, game time and the 
					date you actually saved. The game menu is opened via <key>Esc</key> and the save
					game box is opened either via the game menu or the <key>s</key> key.
				</para>
				<para>
					In <Exult/>, you can still move your party even if there is a box/body/stats
					open/on. In the original, the world was kind of frozen. Now it is only
					frozen if you hit the <key>t</key> or <key>s</key> key.

			<question>
				How do I disable all improvements?
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>
					To get an Ultima 7 that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible there
					are several things to do (though I wonder why you'd want to do that):
				</para>
				<ul>
				<li>make custom keybindings files (see <ref target="exult_keys"/>) in which you disable 
					all the keys that were not in the original for Black Gate and Serpents Isle. 
					Since the Alpha 4 release you have to assign <key>s</key> to old_file_gump
					to enable the old savegame menu (the line in your custom keybindings file should look 
					like: S old_file_gump)</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys.</li>
				<li>Don't set the path to the Serpent Isle files (see <ref target="path_config"/>) and put
					SI and a second copy of <Exult/> in a seperate directory (note: you can no longer 
					launch both BG and SI from the same exult.exe). This disables SI paperdolls in BG.</li>
				<li>Alternatively you can leave the cheat menu binding in the keybindings file (<key>F2</key>) 
					and disable "Paperdolls" each time you run <Exult/>.</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and 
					disable scalers.</li>
				<li>The disc icon in the Avatar paperdoll opens the new game menu. As of now this cannot 
					be altered. Sorry!</li>

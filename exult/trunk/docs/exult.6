.SH NAME
exult \- an engine for running Ultima VII

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exult
.RI [ options ]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Exult
is an engine built for running Ultima VII. It started its life as a map-browser for Ultima VII and has evolved from there, thanks to the open source-model and contributions of time and code from many people.
.PP
You cannot use \fBExult\fP without game data files. At present, the only finished games are Origin's Ultima VII: The Black Gate and Ultima VII, Part 2: The Serpent Isle. In any case, both Ultima VII's are some of the best computer Role-Playing-Games made to date. Check your local computer dealer's bargain bin or an online auction site. Ultima VII can still be purchased for only a few dollars. Run out and buy it!
.PP
There is a world editor available to create your own games: Exult Studio. Check the \fBexult\fP homepage (URL below) for more information.

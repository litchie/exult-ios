Documentation for the bugs in usecode and the corrections that can be made
Started by: Artaxerxes (artaxerxes@users.sf.net)

Forewords:
every action on usecode should be done on the _disassembled_ usecode. Please
use "rip" and "wud" to disassemble usecode appropriately. Once the changes are
made, re-assemble using "wuc" and "rip". Those tools can be found on Exult's
download page.

Unfixed bugs:
=================

(SI) Pillars in Silver Seed fort teleport to Gargoyle test
==========================================================

A slight mistake of the add-on designers. The cool looking pillars in the dining
hall of the Silver Seed fort start the gargoyle city test and teleport the Avatar
to it.
This could be fixed by
- change the usecode to only trigger in the right area
- change the pillars (i.e., change their frame)
- give the 'real' pillar a quality and check for that



(SI) Resurrecting possessed party:
===================================
Author: Clock Nova
Date:   04-21-03 08:36

On the other hand, I would not have thought of using the Hourglass after
releasing the Banes had I not read about it elsewhere. If you use it in the
room where you fought Selena, your companions get "resurrected" so they can
fight themselves later on. Oops!


(BG) Pocketwatch AM/PM confusion:
==================================
Author: MagicMop
Date:   12-14-01 10:12

1. Between 12 and 1 o clock in the afternoon, the time is listed as 'am' not
'pm'

[Note: this has been fixed in SI's usecode.]


(BG,french) Dupre accent confusion:
====================================

The French BG's usecode mixes up Dupre with and without an accent on the e.
This way some conversation options are unreachable.

[Note: fixed by jhoeksma. Need to disassemble fix to include here.]

(BG) liquer conversation bug:
==============================

BG has a conversation in which there are two conversation options named
'liquer'. This prevents the second one from being chosen.

[Note: fixed by jhoeksma. Need to disassemble fix to include here.]


(SI) disappearing pikeman:
===========================

The first part of the banquet usecode in Monitor accidently deletes the
List Field's pikeman egg when you're too close to that egg.




Fixed bugs:
==================

(SI) Gwenno and the Diamond Necklace:
======================================

No matter who has the diamond necklace, Iolo is going to say he's lost it
during the adventures to find Gwenno. This is due to an error in the usecode
function that checks whether you have the diamond or not. It is looking for
the wrong item (the wrong shape actually).

Usecode function: 0495

(SI) Shamino's exchanged-items list
====================================

In the beginning Shamino talks about preparing a list of exchanged 
objects but at a first look at that list his own objects are missing. This 
gets normally corrected in the game at the latest when Dupre or Iolo join.
You might also change usecode function 0402 like this:

Usecode Function 0402:

Code to replace:
025D: 24 0A 00          call    [000A]                  ; 092BH
0260: 13                push    true
0261: 43 A2 02          popf    flag:[02A2]
0264: 1F 00 00          pushi   0000H                   ; 0
0267: 1D 84 03          pushs   L0384                   ; @Such 
strangeness!@
026A: 1F FE FF          pushi   FFFEH                   ; -2
026D: 24 09 00          call    [0009]                  ; 097FH
0270: 24 0B 00          call    [000B]                  ; 09AAH
0273: 1F FE FF          pushi   FFFEH                   ; -2
0276: 39 26 00 01       calli   _add_to_party@1 (0026)

Replace with:
025D: 13                push    true
025E: 43 A2 02          popf    flag:[02A2]
0261: 1F 00 00          pushi   0000H                   ; 0
0264: 1D 84 03          pushs   L0384                   ; @Such 
strangeness!@
0267: 1F FE FF          pushi   FFFEH                   ; -2
026A: 24 09 00          call    [0009]                  ; 097FH
026D: 24 0B 00          call    [000B]                  ; 09AAH
0270: 1F FE FF          pushi   FFFEH                   ; -2
0273: 39 26 00 01       calli   _add_to_party@1 (0026)
0277: 24 0A 00          call    [000A]

This checks for the exchanged items in the party _after_ Shamino joins.


===============================


(SI) Silk stockings missing from exchanged item list.
=======================================================

Usecode function 092B checks for silk stockings in inventory but sets 
wrong flag (not harmful, sets flag 27A which has already been set by the same 
code call for another object (pinecone)).

Usecode Function 092B

Code to replace:

00DC: 43 7A 02          popf    flag:[027A]

Replace with:

00DC: 43 7B 02          popf    flag:[027B]



===============================

(SI) Filari in exchanged item list. 

On the exchanged items list there should also be the filari in your 
inventory. This is either due to a wrong handling of count_objects by 
exult or a wrong parameter in the usecode. This is the only instance of 
using count_objects like this so I think its probably a bug in usecode. 
count_objects gets called with shapenum 3B4 (filari), quality 14h and 
framenum 0. Normally quality and framenum FE99 (any) is used if 
money is counted, only not in this case. The result is that the 
parameters do not match the characteristics of the filari in your 
inventory (quality=87dec, framenum=7) and are ignored.

Usecode Function 092C:

replace:

0057: 1F 14 00          pushi   0014H                   ; 20
with: 
0057: 1F 99 FE          pushi   FE99H                   ; -359


and

0087: 1F 00 00          pushi   0000H                   ; 0
with
0087: 1F 99 FE          pushi   FE99H                   ; -359


(SI) Resurrecting Gwenno:
==========================

Gwennos activity flag gets set to 3 (talk) by the resurrect function (She 
is even handled especially). This
triggers an automatic conversation when the Avatar stands near her (event 
== 0 or 9 I assume) and skips the function that checks for her 
status: (!UI_get_item_flag(0xFF6B, 0x001E). When you stand far enough 
apart this should not happen anyway. 

Usecode function 08FE:

replace 
0109: 1F 03 00          pushi   0003H                   ; 3
with 
0109: 1F 0C 00          pushi   000CH                   ; 12

(0C = wander) and this should not happen.

				<p>
					<em>Exult</em> is not only capable of playing Ultima 7 but it is also intended as
					an engine in the style of the one used by Ultima 7. <em>Exult Studio</em> started it's life
					as a simple map editor but it is slowly developing into a full fledged editor
					enabling users to create a new game. Tristan came up with the cool name!
				</p>
				<p>
					The main purpose of <em>Exult Studio</em> is the ability to create an entirely original
					game world without using the original Ultima 7 data files. Its semi-possible
					already but still requires a lot of work. Not the least of which is that an entire
					games worth of art needs to be created.
				</p>
				<p>
					Editing a copyrighted game may or may not be allowed. Please exercise caution especially
					if you want to distribute your changes.

				<p>
					<em>Exult Studio</em> is work in progress. How things work may change and new features are
					added very frequently. Due to that the maintainers (Jeffrey, Dominus) of this
					documentation may not have been able to update it. As we do not have an official
					release yet this documentation refers to recent snapshots.
				</p>
				<p>
					This guide is what we hope will be an ongoing effort to provide up to date and
					in-depth information on how to get the most out of <em>Exult Studio</em>. Accuracy is an
					essential part of this guide. If you find something that could be clearer or doesn't
					seem worded properly please tell us, we will be happy to change this guide. Tips and
					tricks by other users will be appreciated as well and will of course be credited.

				<p>
					Of course the terms explained in <a href="ReadMe.html#terms">ReadMe</a> are
					also used in this Documentation but we will list them along with the terms
					that additionally need to be explained for the usage of <em>Exult Studio</em>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>tile</strong>:<br />
						8x8 pixels</li>
					<li><strong>chunk</strong>:<br />
						16x16 tiles</li>
					<li><strong>superchunk</strong>:<br />
						16x16 chunks</li>
					<li><strong>world</strong>:<br />
						12x12 superchunks</li>
					<li><strong>NPC schedules</strong>:<br />
						NPCs can have schedules which make them do certain things at certain times.</li>
					<li><strong>BG</strong>, <strong>SI</strong>, <strong>FoV</strong>
					or <strong>SS</strong>:<br />
						we refer to "Ultima 7: The Black Gate" as BG and to "Ultima 7: Serpent Isle"
						as SI. The add-ons "Forge of Virtue" and "Silver Seed" are called FoV and SS.</li>
					<li><strong>eggs</strong>:<br />
						these are trip-wires that cause monsters to spawn, execute scripts, play music,
						change weather, trigger traps, teleport when you get near them.</li>
					<li><strong>flex files</strong>:<br />
						or flexes are used by the original to store the data files.
						Also when you choose not use compressed save games (see save_compression_level in
						<a href="ReadMe.html#exult_config">ReadMe</a>) our save games are also "flexed".</li>
					<li><strong>gumps</strong>:<br />
						the windows used in the game interface for containers, characters, menus, etc..</li>
					<li><strong>paperdoll</strong>:<br />
						when pressing 
	'<font color="maroon">i</font>'
 you get the inventory display. It's the picture of your
						characters body (or the bodies of your party members) onto which you can drag all
						kinds of equipment. The way this is displayed in SI is what we call
						<strong>paperdoll</strong>. We integrated this for BG as well.
						(see <a href="faq.html#improvements">FAQ</a>).</li>
					<li><strong>shapes</strong>:<br />
						shape files are the format used for storage of all graphics elements (from UI buttons
						to terrain features) of the games Exult supports. Shapes may contain one or more
						frames (a frame is a single image).</li>
					<li><strong>snapshot</strong>:<br />
						see <a href="faq.html#whatis_snapshot">FAQ</a>.<br />
						Please note that our documentation usually refers to the latest snapshot.</li>
					<li><strong>usecode</strong>:<br />
						that's the scripting language that drives all of U7 (conversations, objects...).</li>
					<li><strong>Exult data directory</strong>:<br />
						that's the directory where Exult stores its data files (exult.flx, exult_bg.flx and
						exult_si.flx).</li>

				<ul>
					<li>You need <em>Exult</em> and you need to install it properly
						(see <a href="ReadMe.html#installation">ReadMe</a>). Also make sure that
						you are using the <strong>latest snapshot of the 1.1.x branch</strong> of <em>Exult</em>.<br />
						<em>Exult Studio</em> only works with the latest snapshot, not the latest release.</li>
					<li>For U*ix platforms you need to build <em>Exult Studio</em> from the source available from our
						source snapshot at <a href="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php">http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php</a>.<br />
						You will also need the GTK+ library installed as well as

					<li>For Win32 platforms (Win9x,ME,2k,XP) you need to download

				<p>
					You can run <em>Exult Studio</em> all by itself, but it isn't useful that way,
					as it uses <em>Exult</em> as a server. What you really want to do is:
				</p>
				<ul>
   				<li>Put 'exult_studio.glade' in the <em>Exult</em> 'data' directory.</li>
   				<li>Be sure 'exult_studio' is in your path. (on Win32
   					'exult_studio.exe' needs to be in the same directory as exult.exe)</li>
				<li>On U*ix platforms you need to be running <em>Exult</em> on X.</li>
   				<li>Run <em>Exult</em> in <strong>windowed mode</strong> (not fullscreen).</li>
   				<li>Press 'alt+ctrl+m' to go into 'map-editor' mode. If all is set
					up correctly, exult_studio will start up, and will have a list of files
					on the left side of its window (you need to have cheats enabled in <em>Exult</em>,
					see the <a href="ReadMe.html#gameplay_gump">ReadMe</a>).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Starting up one or the other separately will reconnect them:
				</p>
				<ul>
    			<li>If <em>Exult</em> isn't running, start it up. Then, in <em>Exult Studio</em>,
					use the 'File' menu to choose the static directory (for the game you're
					playing).</li>
   				<li>If <em>Exult Studio</em> isn't running start it up with:
        			exult_studio -x (path to dir containing exult_studio.glade) -gGAME
        			(GAME is the same string (ie, 'blackgate') that we use in .exult.cfg or that
        			you've given to your own game).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can also reconnect by selecting File-Connect in <em>Exult Studio</em>'s
					menus.

				<p>
					The above instructions may still be too technical for everybody.
					You have to make sure all these steps are taken care of before you're going to get
					very far with your world building.
				</p>
				<ol>
				<li>While it is not explicitly needed it is useful to have a working copy of either
					BG or SI properly installed onto your computer.</li>
				<li>Next, you need to have the Exult 1.1x snapshot and the SDL mixer installed properly
					onto your computer and working correctly. If you are currently playing either BG or SI
					on your machine this is probably done right. To make sure you have the correct version,
					ensure that it says 1.10 CVS during Exult's start-up screen.</li>
				<li>You need to make sure the newest version of <em>Exult Studio</em> is installed properly onto your
					computer as well. <em>Exult Studio</em> should be installed in the same directory as the Exult 1.10x
					snapshot.</li>
				<li>You <strong>need</strong> to set up the path for the patch to save any changes to existing
					games. See <a href="#can_do_atm">2.4. What you can do at the moment</a> on how to change exult.cfg accordingly.</li>
				<li>In order for <em>Exult Studio</em> to work properly, you need to have <em>Exult</em> running in windowed mode.
					If you can see your desktop while playing, then you're doing it right.</li>
				<li>Make sure you have Cheats enabled. This can be enabled in the Gameplay options of the Game
					menu.</li>
				<li>While running <em>Exult</em> in windowed mode, hit 
	'<font color="maroon">ctrl+alt+m</font>'
 to enter map-editing mode.
					<em>Exult Studio</em> should open up if you did everything correctly. In map-editing mode the world is
					frozen, but you are still able to move your characters around in order to place objects.
					You're now ready to start your world editing. You should be seeing something like this:</li>

				<p>
					With the latest source you can
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>browse shapes in the main window.</li>
   						<li>drag a shape from the shape browser to <em>Exult</em>, and that
							object will be placed in the game.</li>
   						<li>edit an 'egg' by double-clicking on it. An edit box
							should appear.</li>
   						<li>create a new 'egg' using the pull-down menu in <em>Exult Studio</em>.
							In the Egg edit box, after you hit 'Apply', you'll be prompted to
							click in <em>Exult</em> where you want the egg to appear.</li>
   						<li>if editing a 'monster' egg, you can set the monster by dragging
							the shape from the browser to the area that displays the monster.</li>
						<li>edit an NPC by double-clicking on it, and also create a new
							NPC using the pull-down menu. Attributes, flags, and schedules can
							all be viewed and modified.</li>
						<li>edit other objects' position and quality by double-clicking on them.</li>
						<li>browse the 'u7chunks' file, and drag them into <em>Exult</em> to change
							the terrain. In this browser, you can also create new terrains and
							modify their order.</li>
						<li>select a chunk, choose 'Paint with chunks' from the 'Mode' menu, and then
							paint terrain with that whole chunk.</li>
						<li>edit a 'terrain' (stored in 'u7chunks') by clicking the "Edit
							terrain" checkbox in <em>Exult Studio</em>. This is a special mode where
							dragging with the left mouse button 'paints' the currently-selected
							shape (generally one of the flat tiles near the top of the shapes
							browser). Note that a 'terrain' is generally used in multiple places
							in the map and changing it in one place changes it in all the others as well.</li>
						<li>save the map using <em>Exult Studio</em>'s "File-Save map" pulldown menu.
							In order to avoid writing over files inadvertently, the files that
							would normally go into the 'static' directory, will, instead, go into
							a 'patch' directory that you specify in your 'exult.cfg' file. Here's
							an example for editing BG:</li>

					Once <em>Exult Studio</em> runs correctly , a tree of game files is displayed to the left of
					the main window, while the currently selected file is viewed in detail to the right.<br />
					<img alt="Exult Studio default view" src="images/studio02.png" /><br />

			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="shape_files">3.2. Shape files</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					Shapes are the basic graphical elements of the game. Each shape has one or more
					frames that typically represent different states or angles of the same thing.
					E.g. a button shape could have frames for pressed, and released; a character
					could have frames depicting her sitting, standing up facing one way, or another,
					swinging a punch, etc.<br />
					When a shape file is selected, the right part of the main window will show frame
					zero of the shapes contained therein. Shapes can be selected by clicking, which
					will show there number, number of frames, and name if known. Other frames can be
					viewed by changing the frame number.
				</p>
				<p>
					When the selected file contains shapes that have names in their info you can also use
					the find option to find shapes that have that name (e.g. in shapes.vga you can search
					for 'door' to find all shapes that have door frames). You can search down or up in the
					selected file.
				</p>
				<p>
					When viewing shapes you can press the button 'Frames' in the lower right corner of
					<em>Exult Studio</em> to show all the frames of a shape next to each others.
				</p>
				<p>
					Shape files also have a special right-click-menu. See <a href="#shape_edit">5.1. The shape editor</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Typical shape files are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Sprites.vga</strong><br />
						displays all the animations that can be used to overlay the screen.</li>
					<li><strong>Shapes.vga</strong><br />
						displays the objects that can be placed onto the world.</li>
					<li><strong>Fonts.vga</strong><br />
						displays all text graphics used throughout the game.</li>
					<li><strong>Faces.vga</strong><br />
						contains all of the graphics for conversation pictures..</li>
					<li><strong>Pointers.shp</strong><br />

					An egg in its simplest form is an object that is placed in the world, but is
					invisible to a normal user. When the player meets the requirements of an egg,
					it causes the egg to become activated. Eggs can activate anything from monster
					spawns, to changes in the current music, to the activation of custom usecode. You
					may want to place the eggs in map-editing mode because eggs don't activate in this
					mode. Then switch off map-editing mode to test how your egg will work during game

					Currently <em>Exult Studio</em> supports the following types of eggs (more details follow):
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Monster</strong>(spawning)<br />
						allows for the creation of a creature when certain conditions are met, usually
						when your character gets within a certain distance of the egg.
						It also allows for the creation of simple objects like walls or furniture to
						appear when the Avatar gets near. This could make for some interesting effects.</li>
					<li><strong>Jukebox</strong><br />
						sets the background music when the character enters a certain area.</li>
					<li><strong>Sound Effect</strong> and <strong>Voice</strong><br />
						will play a selected sound or voice when the character meets the required values
						set in the egg creation menu.</li>
					<li><strong>Usecode</strong><br />
						allows for the activation of custom usecode when an egg's requirements are met.
						The creation of custom usecode is discussed (though not in depth) at
						<a href="#usecode_edit">5.3.</a>.</li>
					<li><strong>Missile</strong><br />
						create interesting objects like flamethrower traps.</li>
					<li><strong>Teleport</strong><br />
						transport the avatar anywhere on the map when certain conditions are met.</li>
					<li><strong>Weather</strong><br />
						temporarily set the in-game weather.</li>
					<li><strong>Path</strong><br />
						set the destination of a teleport egg to a specific object.</li>

					The most convenient way to create an egg is to select <strong>Create new egg</strong>
					from the edit menu. This will pop up the <strong>Exult Egg</strong> window. Here you
					can select the type of egg you wish to create and the properties you are going to
					give it. When you are happy with the egg press <strong>apply</strong> and then enter
					<em>Exult</em> and place the egg wherever you like. To remove an egg, select it while in

					elsewhere if you like. To edit an egg, double click it in map editing mode. This

					attributes.
				</p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="eggs_properties">6.4. Properties of eggs</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					Before you select the type of egg you want you can edit basic properties of eggs.
					These are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Probability</strong><br />
						of the egg being activated. By giving an egg a probability of 100 you can ensure
						that whenever the requirements necessary to make an egg activate are met, the egg
						will activate. With a probability of 0 nothing will ever happen when the egg's
						requirements are met. A probability anywhere between 0 and 100 will cause the
						activation of an egg to be a random event.</li>
					<li><strong>Distance</strong><br />
						allows you to set how far a character needs to be from an egg in order to activate
						it. Each distance unit is equal to one tile (8x8 pixel) of the map.</li>
					<li><strong>Criteria</strong><br />
						is very important as it sets what needs to be done to activate the egg. The
						options are:<br />
						<strong>Cached in</strong> - An egg with this characteristic is activated when
						the chunk it is on is loaded into memory. This usually happens from several screens
						away.<br />
						<strong>Party near</strong> - causes an egg to be activated whenever the player
						controlled character or any of his party members wander within the area specified
						by the distance option.<br />
						<strong>Avatar near</strong> - exactly the same as party near except only registers
						where the main character is moved, ignoring actions by the party members.<br />
						<strong>Avatar far</strong> - Its like Avatar near except with a twist. This
						property allows you to walk into the area specified by the distance property but then
						as you leave the area the egg will be activated as you distance yourself from it.
						Can be great for sneak attacks from behind.<br />
						<strong>Avatar footpad</strong> - In this case the distance property is ignored and
						the Avatar has to physically step onto the egg.<br />
						<strong>Party footpad</strong> - This option is identical to the Avatar footpad option
						except if either the main character or one of his companions stumbles onto the egg it
						will be activated.<br />
						<strong>Something on</strong> - This egg is activated whenever an object is placed
						within the area specified by an egg.<br />
						<strong>External</strong> - Eggs set to the external characteristic will be activated
						by button eggs in the vicinity.
						</li>
					<li><strong>Flag</strong><br />
						final attribute you can give an egg to determine whether it will be activated or not.
						As a note you can mix and match flags, you can set an egg to nocturnal once only or
						nocturnal auto-reset.<br />
					 	<strong>Nocturnal</strong> - Any egg with this setting will only be activated during
					 	the nighttime. Great for setting the spawning of creatures of the night, or giving
					 	some nice night time music.<br />
						<strong>Hatched</strong> - This creates an egg that has already been activated. It
						is inactive and will not do anything.<br />
						<strong>Once-Only</strong> - Any egg with this flag applied will only hatch once and
						then disappear from the game world.<br />
						<strong>Auto-reset</strong> - Eggs with this flag attached will continue to activate
						every time the conditions set in the egg menu are met.</li>

				<p>
					The first thing you want to consider before placing monster spawn is some of the basic egg
					attributes. What probability do you want? What distance? Will it be a nocturnal creature?
					Next you have to set the monster specific egg attributes. The first question is probably
					what type of monster you want to place. You can now switch to the main <em>Exult Studio</em> window,
					select shapes.vga and choose a shape. Drag and drop this on the "Exult Egg" window. Frame #
					isn't overly important when placing a monster, but for placing an object it can be very
					important. Enter these attributes into their respective form. You next have to set the
					monster's schedule. The various schedules that are important for a monster spawn are
					discussed next. You also have to set the spawned monster's alignment.<br />
					Any creature set to a neutral alignment will ignore the Avatar and friends, following their
					schedule until attacked. Any creature set to hostile will immediately attack the Avatar if
					you get too close. Using the friendly alignment naturally evil creatures such as ethereal
					monsters will still attack, but good or neutral characters such as stone golems will continue
					out their assigned schedule if given the friendly alignment.<br />
					As a final monster spawn option, you can set the number of creatures you want to appear using
					the count option. You can set anywhere from 1 to 31 monsters. When you're finished setting
					the egg how you want, simply press "Apply" and place the egg on the world map.<br />

				<p>
					When setting a monster spawn you will most like want to use one of the following schedules.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Horiz. Pace</strong><br />
						Any creature given this schedule will pace back and forth in a horizontal manner. Great
						for guards and sentries</li>
					<li><strong>Vert. Pace</strong><br />
						Same as the horizontal pace, except in a vertical direction.</li>
					<li><strong>Hound</strong><br />
						Any creature given this schedule will slowly follow the main character wherever he goes.
						Good for creatures that won't take no for an answer.</li>
					<li><strong>Stand</strong><br />
						Creatures given this setting will stand in one place until given a better reason to move.</li>
					<li><strong>Loiter</strong><br />
						Creatures given this setting will wander aimlessly. They will move in random directions
						a bit at a time.</li>
					<li><strong>Wander</strong><br />
						Any creature given this setting will slowly move around a fairly large area.</li>
					<li><strong>Wait</strong><br />
						Creatures given this setting will complacently stay in one place.</li>
					<li><strong>Shy</strong><br />
						Creatures given this setting are afraid of the main character and will slowly wander away
						from the Avatar.</li>
					<li><strong>Waiter</strong><br />
						Give a creature this schedule and watch him run back and forth around a crowded area like
						he has a purpose.</li>
					<li><strong>Graze</strong><br />
						An awful lot like loiter except the character seems to stay a little more to one area.</li>
					<li><strong>Duel</strong><br />

					The primary purpose of the teleport egg is to simply move a character from one place to another
					instantly without forcing them to walk there. Think of any dungeon teleporter that moves you
					from one place to another.<br />
					The teleport egg has two primary modes. The first mode possessed by the teleport egg is to
					choose the location that the party will be warped to by specifying a location on the over world
					map using x and y co-ordinates. If you place an egg on the map and a character meets the
					criteria specified by the egg they will be whisked away to the x and y coordinates set by the
					egg. This option can't be used to move your character onto roofs because there is no z option
					provided.<br />
					To switch to the other mode of teleporting, press the use coordinates button.
					This directs the teleported towards a numbered path egg. By giving a path egg a unique number
					and then placing it on the map any teleporter set to this egg will transport the player there.
					The advantage of teleporting using a path egg is you can teleport your character onto the second
					floor of a building if the path egg is placed up there.

				<p>
					Perhaps the simplest way of making your world truly unique is to start out by moving existing
					structures around. Move is the default option in <em>Exult Studio</em>, but to ensure you are in move
					mode select it from the mode menu. You know you are in map-editing mode when a red grid is
					highlighted across the world. You can select any object (notice the red highlighting of
					selected objects) with the mouse and move it around. This works using a simple drag and drop
					approach. Simply grab a tree with a right click and place it on the other side of your viewing
					area. The only thing you can't drag and drop are chucks, which are the large ground sections
					mapped by the red grid system. If you want to place one object on top of another, just drag it
					on top and release. If the object can be supported in that position it will stay there. For a
					brief guide on placing an object that won't have support, but will be floating see further down.
					You can also change an object's x and y coordinates by selecting the object and pressing
					
	'<font color="maroon">ctrl+arrow keys</font>'

					To change the large pieces of map that are sandwiched between the red lines of the map-editing

					are located under the heading U7chunks. The chunks are many large pieces of preformed landscape
					that help give the world a more consistent feel. They also make the job of editing the world
					somewhat easier. To place a chunk simply place it the same way that you would a shape, but keep
					in mind that chunks can only be placed within the red squared formed by the map-editing grid.<br />
					<img alt="chunk placing" src="images/studio08.png" />
				</p>
				<p>
					There are a lot of interesting chunks already available in the chunks.vga file, but what if you
					want to make some minor changes to the design of a pre-made chunk? Maybe make the Britannia
					transport system a little more safe by painting a yellow line down the centre of each road chunk.
					By selecting the Edit terrain option you can change a chunk by placing objects directly onto a
					chunk, doing this permanently changes the chunk you are editing so be careful. It may not look it,
					but if you then select the chunk you edited from the chunks.vga menu the chunk you place will
					have the changes you made. Also be careful because when you edit a chunk you change every chunk
					in the game that is the same as the chunk you're editing. To solve this problem go into the chunks
					menu and right click the chunk you want to edit and select new, then duplicate. You now have two
					identical chunks. You can then place your new chunk onto the world and edit it how you like
					without editing the other chunks. You can now place this duplicate chunk wherever you like and
					it will have the changes you made.

				<p>
					A map-editor needs to provide the ability to display the game, place
					objects on the map, and move objects around. That functionality is already in
					<em>Exult</em>, and it makes sense to reuse it. So we could have made <em>Exult</em> a part of
					<em>Exult Studio</em>. However, <em>Exult</em> is already a huge program, and is getting
					unwieldy to work on.
				</p>
				<p>
					With this architecture, <em>Exult Studio</em> can have all the messy code for
					displaying/editing dialog boxes, while <em>Exult</em> only needs a little bit
					of work to handle requests.

  					drag objects to where you want.</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					This confused me too, and I originally planned on doing away with it.
					But do a little arithmetic:  U7's world has 3072x3072 tiles; that's
					over 9 million that need to be set. My guess is that they came up
					with the idea behind 'u7chunks' to save artists time and to give the
					map a consistent look.
				</p>
				<p>
					The basic idea is that each 'chunk' of flat terrain, 16x16 tiles, is
					stored in 'u7chunks', and is indexed by its position in this file (0,
					1, 2, ...). The 'u7map' file specifies, for each 'chunk' in the U7
					map, which of the terrains is to be used. Since the entire map has
					192x192 chunks, or a total of 36,864, and since 'u7chunks' has 3072
					entries, each terrain is shared an average of over 10 times. When you
					go into map-editing mode in Exult, the numbers displayed are the
					indices from 'u7chunks'.
				</p>
				<p>
					So here are the three sorts of scenery that you can see and edit:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The 'terrain' (flat landscape, rocks, shrubs, and first-story
    					buildings) specified in 'u7chunks' and 'u7map'.</li>
    				<li>Other non-moveable objects (second-floor structures, trees) specified in
    					the 'ifixnn' files.</li>
    				<li>Moveable and changeable objects specified in the 'iregnn' files.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					The challenge of writing a map-editor is keeping the above straight,
					and reading/storing from/to the correct files. It's sorta-kinda
					working now :-)

					For a more detailed explanation, see Gary Thompson's paper,

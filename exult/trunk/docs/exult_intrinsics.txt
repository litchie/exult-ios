================================================================================
GENERAL DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

For Usecode C purposes, the avatar is an NPC just like any other. Constants
referred to below (usually in ALL CAPS) are defined in 'src/headers/contants.uc'
unless otherwise stated.

Unlike Usecode C-defined functions, intrinsics do not have a 'prototype'; you
can pass as many (or as few) parameters to an intrinsic as you like. The only
'hard' limits are that Exult will not like if you (1) call an intrinsic with
more than 12 parameters or (2) the intrinsic expects parameters which you
haven't supplied. The parameter lists in the list below is the minimum safe
number of parameters.

To the right of many intrinsic 'prototypes', you can see an indicator between
square brackets. This indicator is a quick way to see if that intrinsic is
available for the specific game you are interested in. The possible values of
these indicators are:

    Indicator        Meaning
    [BG]             BG-specific intrinsic
    [SI]             SI-specific intrinsic
    [Exult]          Exult-specific intrinsic, available to both BG and SI
    [BG, Exult]      Originally BG-only, Exult allows it in SI too
    [SI, Exult]      Originally SI-only, Exult allows it in BG too
    [Exult: BG]      Exult-specific intrinsic, available only to BG
    [Exult: SI]      Exult-specific intrinsic, available only to SI
    (not present)    Intrinsic available for BG and SI

The '[Exult]', '[BG, Exult]' and '[SI, Exult]' indicators are essentially
equivalent to no indicator at all; they are used in this document only for
completeness.

The intrinsic prototypes below are in Usecode C-esque form. It is actually more
like C than Usecode C. Specifically, all parameters have a type instead of the
Usecode C-'var'. The parameter type indicates what Exult will be expecting; the
Usecode C compiler won't care in the slightest what you pass as a parameter. The
parameter types I use are as follows:

    Keyword     Description
    int         This means any integer, positive or negative.
    object      Any object or NPC. It can be an object reference, 'item' or a
                number (that *must* be negative, which Exult will convert to an
                NPC if it is in the correct range).
    actor       Any NPC. It is evaluated the same way as 'object' is, but Exult
                will reject anything that can't be converted to an NPC. Monsters
                are also accepted.
    bool        A 'true'/'false' parameter. Can be a number (nonzero/zero), an
                array (non-empty/empty) or a comparison expression (e.g., 'a ==
                b'.
    string      A string (text). Strings in usecode are any set of characters
                surrounded by double-quotes; for example, "This is a string.".
                If you need a double-quote inside a string you can 'escape' it
                by prefixing them with a backslash: "\""; alternatively, Exult
                converts '@' into a double-quote.
    function    A usecode function, which *must* be declared with either, the
                shape# /or/ the object# specifiers. In Usecode C, this can be
                the function name or its usecode number. For example: 'extern
                Bolt shape#(0x2D3) ();' can be passed as 'Bolt' (the function
                name), '0x2D3' (its function number since 'shape#(shnum) ==
                shnum' if shnum < 0x400) or as '&Bolt' (using the 'address of'
                operator '&' to get the function number).

If the parameter name is followed by a '[]', it indicates an array with elements
of the specified type. Example: 'actor npc[]' means an array of NPCs. If there
is a number between the brackets, it means an array of that length; for example,
'int num[3]' means an array with 3 'int' elements. In some cases, an array can
be of type 'mixed' to indicate that not all of the array's elements are of the
same type.

Some intrinsics are 'overloaded'; i.e., they accept more than one parameter
type. In those cases, all of the possibilities are listed as prototypes.

If the parameter list is simply '[special]', see the description for details.

If the intrinsic is preceded by a parameter type, it means that the intrinsic
returns something of that type; the description explains the return value. In
some cases, the return value can be 'mixed[]' to indicate that the intrinsic
returns an array, not all of which are of the same type.

All intrinsics can be called as presented in the list. If an intrinsic has at
least one parameter, it can be called in 'calle' form, with the first parameter
as its 'object'. Example:

    int UI_execute_usecode_array(object obj, int script[]);
    int obj->execute_usecode_array(int script[]);

The first parameter and the '->' can both be omitted if 'obj' is 'item', and if
you omit either of them you *must* omit both or the Usecode will fail to
compile. For stylistic purposes, the 'calle' form should be used only when the
first parameter is an object or NPC (or 'item'). For all intrinsics with
'appropriate' parameter types, I have listed both forms in the list below.

Also, you may have noticed that I did not include the parameter type of 'obj'
when I gave the 'calle' form of execute_usecode_array; since I will only give
the 'calle' form when the parameter type is 'object' or 'actor', I feel that it
is unneeded.

================================================================================
RANDOM NUMBER INTRINSICS
================================================================================

    These intrinsics are all related to random numbers and their generation.

int UI_get_random(int max)

    Generates a random number, similar to rolling a dice of the given side.

  Parameters:
    max    The maximum value of the random number. Should be positive.

  Return:
    Zero if max is zero; otherwise, a random number ranging from 1 to max.

int UI_die_roll(int min, int max)

    Generates a random number in the specified range.

  Parameters:
    min    The minimum value of the random number. Should be positive.
    max    The maximum value of the random number. Should be positive.

  Return:
    A random number ranging from min to max. If min > max, the two parameters
    are reversed by Exult.

bool UI_roll_to_win(int att, int def)

    Performs a contest between two supplied values.

  Parameters:
    att    What should be added to the die roll, improving the chances of
           success.
    def    What should be subtracted from the die roll, reducing the chances of
           success.

  Return:
    The contest is a roll of a 30-sided die: if the die comes up 30, the return
    is true; if it comes up 1, the return is false. For all other values, the
    attack value is added to the die roll and the defense value is subtracted
    from the same roll. If the result is 15 or more, the attacker wins and the
    return is true; otherwise, the attacker loses and the return is false.

================================================================================
SCRIPTING INTRINSICS
================================================================================

    These intrinsics are used to animate characters from usecode. Some of these
    are deprecated by script blocks, but all others are still useful at times.

int UI_execute_usecode_array(object obj, int script[])
int obj->execute_usecode_array(int script[])

    Deprecated; use Usecode C script blocks instead. Animates an object
    according to the supplied script.

  Parameters:
    obj       The object to be animated.
    script    The sequence of actions to be executed.

  Return:
    Always returns '1'.

int UI_delayed_execute_usecode_array(object obj, int script[], int delay)
int obj->delayed_execute_usecode_array(int script[], int delay)

    Deprecated; use Usecode C script blocks instead. Animates an object
    according to the supplied script after a delay. Works exactly like
    execute_usecode_array, but starts only after the specified delay.

  Parameters:
    obj       The object to be animated.
    script    The sequence of actions to be executed.
    delay     The number of ticks that must elapse before the animation starts.

  Return:
    Always returns '1'.

bool UI_in_usecode(object obj)
bool obj->in_usecode()

    Checks if an object is currently executing any usecode scripts.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object to be inspected.

  Return:
    true if there are any scripts for the specified object, false otherwise.

UI_halt_scheduled(object obj)
obj->halt_scheduled()

    Terminates usecode scripts that animate the supplied object. Scripts that
    include the 'nohalt' command are not affected by this intrinsic.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose scripts should be terminated.

UI_begin_casting_mode(actor npc, int val)                                [Exult]
npc->begin_casting_mode(int val)

    Makes an NPC display casting frames until the end of its next script.

  Parameters:
    npc    The NPC that should display casting frames.
    val    The shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' to use as casting frames. If omitted, this
           is assumed to be shape 859.

int UI_set_to_attack(actor attacker, object target, int weapon)
int attacker->set_to_attack(object target, int weapon)
int UI_set_to_attack(actor attacker, mixed[4] target, int weapon)
int attacker->set_to_attack(mixed[4] target, int weapon)

    Schedules a NPC to attack the object with a given weapon. This intrinsic
    does not animate the NPC in any way; the scheduled attack only emulates the
    actual hit with the selected weapon. The actual attack is triggered by a
    script; in an Usecode C script, use the 'attack' command to actually perform
    the attack.

  Parameters:
    attacker    Who is attacking.
    target      What is being attacked. Can be an object, NPC, or the return of
                a click_on_item intrinsic call, even if a tile has been clicked.
    weapon      What shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' to use as the source of the weapon
                information in the attack. It *must* specify a shape that has a
                'weapon' tab in Exult Studio, or nothing will happen.

    If the NPC is targeting a tile, the attack will only be meaningful if the
    weapon causes an explosion.

  Return:
    true if attacking a valid target with a valid weapon, false otherwise.

bool UI_path_run_usecode(int pos[], function fun, object obj, int event, int
        simode)

    Causes the avatar to walk to a location and execute the specified usecode
    function when he/she arrives at the destination. If a path cannot be found
    for the destination, no usecode will be executed unless a call to
    set_path_failure intrinsic is made before returning from usecode.

    The avatar can be prevented from reaching his/her destination simply by
    moving away from the path; this will cancel the effects of the intrinsic,
    and will cause the usecode function set by set_path_failure to be called. If
    you want the path to be uninterruptible, the avatar's DONT_MOVE flag must be
    set (this is flag 22 in BG and 16 in SI).

    The other party members will follow the avatar towards the destination.

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    In SI, path_run_usecode finds a free spot within 3 tiles of the position
    specified by 'pos'; it also allows a rise/drop of 3 in the z direction.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

  Parameters:
    pos       The location that the avatar should walk to. Can be a (x, y)
              position or a (x, y, z) position. If the z coordinate is missing,
              or if it is negative, it is assumed to be zero.
    fun       The usecode function to be called if the destination is reached.
    obj       The object that should be used as item if the usecode function is
              called. If this parameter is zero, usecode will *not be called* at
              all.
    event     The event that should be used if the usecode function is called.
    simode    This optional parameter can be used to control whether or not to
              use the SI-specific behavior described above. It defaults to true
              in SI and to false in BG.

  Return:
    If no path can be found to the destination, returns false; otherwise,
    returns true.

UI_si_path_run_usecode(actor npc, int pos[], int event,              [SI, Exult]
        object obj, function fun, bool flag)
npc->si_path_run_usecode(int pos[], int event, object obj, function fun, bool
        flag)

    Causes an NPC to walk to a location and execute the specified usecode
    function when he/she arrives at the destination. If a path cannot be found
    for the destination, no usecode will be executed unless a call to
    set_path_failure intrinsic is made before returning from usecode.

    The avatar can be prevented from reaching his/her destination simply by
    moving away from the path; similarly, a scheduled event or scripted event
    may prevent an NPC from reaching his/her destination. In these cases, the
    effects of the intrinsic will be cancelled, and the usecode function set by
    set_path_failure will be called. If you want the path to be uninterruptible,
    the NPC's DONT_MOVE flag must be set (this is flag 22 in BG and 16 in SI).

  Parameters:
    npc      The NPC that will be affected by this intrinsic. If this isn't a
             valid NPC, nothing will happen.
    pos      The location that the NPC should walk to. Can be a (x, y) position
             or a (x, y, z) position. If the z coordinate is missing, or if it
             is negative, it is assumed to be zero.
    event    The event that should be used if the usecode function is called.
    obj      The object that should be used as item if the usecode function is
             called. If this parameter is zero, usecode will *not be called* at
             all.
    fun      The usecode function to be called if the destination is reached.
    flag     Flag specifying whether or not the usecode function should always
             be called. If false, it will be called only if the NPC can reach
             its intended destination; if true, the specified usecode function
             will be called even if the destination cannot be reached. The
             set_path_failure intrinsic will override this flag in either case.

UI_set_path_failure(function fun, object obj, int event)

    Sets usecode to be called if an NPC fails to reach its destination. This
    intrinsic must be used *after* a call to either, path_run_usecode or
    si_path_run_usecode intrinsics, and will affect only the NPC affected by
    that call. If, for any reason, the NPC in question cannot reach the
    destination, the usecode function assigned by this intrinsic will be run.

  Parameters:
    fun      The usecode function to be called if the path fails.
    obj      The object that should be used as item if the usecode function is
             called. If this parameter is zero, usecode will *not be called* at
             all.
    event    The event that should be used if the usecode function is called.

bool UI_in_usecode_path(actor npc)
bool npc->in_usecode_path()

    Checks whether or not the actor is transversing a path due to
    path_run_usecode or si_path_run_usecode inteinsics.

  Parameters:
    npc    The NPC to be checked.

  Return:
    true if the NPC is still walking a usecode path, false otherwise.

UI_telekenesis(function fun)

    Deprecated; stores a usecode function for special script behavior. The next
    *script* call to the stored function (e.g., 'script item call fun;') will
    have an event ID of 'DOUBLECLICK' instead of the standard 'SCRIPTED' event
    ID used for scripts. Since Usecode C scripts allow calling a function with
    an event ID of your choice (e.g., 'script item call fun, DOUBLECLICK;') it
    is best to simply ignore this intrinsic.

  Parameters:
    fun    The function to be stored.

================================================================================
CONVERSATION INTRINSICS
================================================================================

    These intrinsics are used to display faces for conversations, storing and
    recalling answers, etc.

UI_show_npc_face(int face, int frnum)
UI_show_npc_face(actor face, int frnum)
face->show_npc_face(int frnum)

    Displays a face onscreen for conversations. The face is a shape from
    'FACES.VGA'. This intrinsic finds a free slot to display the face in or uses
    the second slot if there are no free slots.

  Parameters:
    face     The face to be displayed. May be an integer or an NPC.
    frnum    The frame number of the face to be displayed.

    If 'face' is an integer, the shape to be displayed is the absolute value of
    this number. If this value is 0 or 356, the avatar's face will be displayed,
    using the correct face for the avatar's skin and PETRA status flag.

    If 'face' is an NPC, the Exult Studio-set face for that NPC is displayed;
    the "default" face is equal to the NPC's number.

    For the cases when 'frnum is zero, you should use Usecode C's 'npc.say()' to
    display the NPC's face and display any text within the parenthesis (or set
    with 'message') too.

UI_show_npc_face0(int face, int frnum)                               [SI, Exult]
UI_show_npc_face0(actor face, int frnum)
face->show_npc_face0(int frnum)

    Displays a face onscreen for conversations. The face is a shape from
    'FACES.VGA'. This intrinsic always uses slot 0 for the new face.

  Parameters:
    face     The face to be displayed. May be an integer or an NPC.
    frnum    The frame number of the face to be displayed.

    If 'face' is an integer, the shape to be displayed is the absolute value of
    this number. If this value is 0 or 356, the avatar's face will be displayed,
    using the correct face for the avatar's skin and PETRA status flag.

    If 'face' is an NPC, the Exult Studio-set face for that NPC is displayed;
    the "default" face is equal to the NPC's number.

    For the cases when 'frnum is zero, you should use Usecode C's 'npc.say()' to
    display the NPC's face and display any text within the parenthesis (or set
    with 'message') too.

UI_show_npc_face1(int face, int face)                                [SI, Exult]
UI_show_npc_face1(actor face, int face)
npc->show_npc_face1(int face)

    Displays a face onscreen for conversations. The face is a shape from
    'FACES.VGA'. This intrinsic always uses slot 1 for the new face.

  Parameters:
    face     The face to be displayed. May be an integer or an NPC.
    frnum    The frame number of the face to be displayed.

    If 'face' is an integer, the shape to be displayed is the absolute value of
    this number. If this value is 0 or 356, the avatar's face will be displayed,
    using the correct face for the avatar's skin and PETRA status flag.

    If 'face' is an NPC, the Exult Studio-set face for that NPC is displayed;
    the "default" face is equal to the NPC's number.

    For the cases when 'frnum is zero, you should use Usecode C's 'npc.say()' to
    display the NPC's face and display any text within the parenthesis (or set
    with 'message') too.

UI_remove_npc_face(int face)
UI_remove_npc_face(actor face)
face->remove_npc_face()

    Deprecated; use Usecode C's 'npc.hide()' statement instead. Hides the
    specified face if it is being shown.

  Parameters:
    face    The face to be hidden. May be an integer or an NPC.

    If 'face' is an integer, the shape to be hidden is the absolute value of
    this number. If this value is 0 or 356, the avatar's face will be hidden.

    If 'face' is an NPC, the Exult Studio-set face for that NPC is hidden; the
    "default" face is equal to the NPC's number.

UI_remove_npc_face0()                                                [SI, Exult]

    Removes whatever face is being shown in slot 0.

UI_remove_npc_face1()                                                [SI, Exult]

    Removes whatever face is being shown in slot 1.

UI_set_conversation_slot(int slot)                                   [SI, Exult]
npc->set_conversation_slot()

    Changes the active conversation slot.

  Parameters:
    slot    The new active slot. Must be zero or one.

UI_change_npc_face0(int frame)                                       [SI, Exult]

    Changes the frame of the face being displayed in slot 0.

  Parameters:
    frame    The new frame to be used.

UI_change_npc_face1(int frame)                                       [SI, Exult]

    Changes the frame of the face being displayed in slot 1.

  Parameters:
    frame    The new frame to be used.

UI_init_conversation()                                                      [SI]

    Initializes the face information for a conversation. In Exult, it is usually
    safe to skip it.

UI_end_conversation()                                                       [SI]

    Shows any pending text and removes all faces from the screen. Usually safe
    to skip this in Exult.

UI_add_answer(string answer)
UI_add_answer(string answer[])

    Deprecated; use Usecode C's 'add(string answer)' or 'add(string answer[])'
    statements instead. Adds the specified strings as dialog options that the
    player can select.

  Parameters:
    answer    A string or array of strings containing the dialog options to be
              added.

UI_remove_answer(string answer)
UI_remove_answer(string answer[])

    Deprecated; use Usecode C's '(remove)' construct instead. Removes the
    supplied strings from the dialog options available to the player.

  Parameters:
    answer    A string or array of strings containing the dialog options to be
              removed.

UI_push_answers()

    Stores the current conversation options and clears all choices. The dialog
    options are stored in a LIFO stack that persists until the dialog ends;
    before that point, the stored options can be retrieved with a call to
    UI_pop_answers intrinsic.

UI_pop_answers()

    Clears all current conversation options and restores the stored conversation
    options, if any. The restored dialog options are those stored by the /last/
    call to UI_push_answers intrinsic.

UI_clear_answers()

    Clears all current dialog options.

string UI_select_from_menu()

    Makes the player choose one answer from all dialog options currently being
    displayed.

  Return:
    The chosen dialog option.

int UI_select_from_menu2()

    Makes the player choose one answer from all dialog options currently being
    displayed.

  Return:
    The index (ranging from 1 to n) of the chosen dialog option.

================================================================================
SOUND INTRINSICS
================================================================================

    All intrinsics in this section relate to playing sound effects, music or
    speech.

UI_play_sound_effect(int sfx)

    Plays a sound effect.

  Parameters:
    sfx    A numerical value indicating the sound effect that should be played.

UI_play_sound_effect2(int sfx, object obj)

    Causes an object to generate a sound effect.

  Parameters:
    sfx    A numerical value indicating the sound effect that should be played.
    obj    The object generating the sound effect. The sound intensity decrease
           as the avatar gets farther away from this object.

UI_play_music(int track, object obj)

    Plays the specified song.

  Parameters:
    track    The track number to be played or 255 (0xFF) to *stop* any music
             that is playing.
    obj      The source of the music, or zero for 'unattached' music. Positive
             numbers are *not* interpreted as NPCs!

    If supplied with a valid object or NPC that is on the game world, this
    intrinsic will also display the sprite effect # 24 (musical notes).

int UI_get_music_track()

    Gets the music being played.

  Return:
    If music is enabled and a song is playing, returns the track number of the
    current song. Otherwise, return is -1.

     NOTES ABOUT ORIGINAL BG 
    The return value in the original Black Gate was more complicated; the
    current song was the return value divided by 256, while the next song (the
    one that would be resumed after the current one ends) was the remainder of
    that same division. None of this behavior is true for Exult, which works as
    described above.
     END NOTES ABOUT ORIGINAL BG 

bool UI_start_speech(int track)

    Plays the specified speech track.

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    In SI, speech also displays a full-screen face from 'FACES.VGA'.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

  Parameters:
    track    Number indicating what speech track is to be played.

  Return:
    Returns false if failed to play the requested speech track (for example, if
    speech is disabled), true otherwise.

int UI_get_speech_track()

    Determines the currently playing speech track.

  Return:
    A number indicating what voice track is being played.

================================================================================
SEARCHING AND COUNTING INTRINSICS
================================================================================

    These intrinsics allow you to find and count objects, whether they are in a
    container or in the game world.

object UI_find_nearest(object obj, int shape, int dist)
object obj->find_nearest(int shape, int dist)

    Searches the area around a given object looking for other objects of a
    specified type.

  Parameters:
    obj      The object around which the search will happen.
    shape    The shape we are looking for. Can be SHAPE_ANY = -359 to match any
             shape.
    dist     The maximum distance from 'obj' that will be considered in the
             search.

  Return:
    An object reference to the nearest object found given the search criteria.
    You cannot find eggs, barges, invisible or transparent objects with this
    intrinsic.

object UI_find_object(object cont, int shape, int qual, int frame)
object cont->find_object(int shape, int qual, int frame)
object UI_find_object(int cont, int shape, int qual, int frame)
object UI_find_object(int cont[3], int shape, int qual, int frame)

    Finds the first object matching the search criteria.

  Parameters:
    cont     The object or location to be searched. Can be a container or NPC, a
             (x, y, z) location, PARTY = -357 to search the whole party or
             FIND_ON_SCREEN = -359 to search a square region around the screen
             location with size given by the screen's height.
    shape    The shape we are looking for.
    qual     The quality that is being sought. Can be QUALITY_ANY = -359 to
             match any quality.
    frame    What frame is desired. Can be FRAME_ANY = -359 to match any frame.

    **** IMPORTANT NOTES ****
    When 'cont' is a position, the search is made in a 1-tile-wide region
    centered on the given position.
    Also, if the search is *not* being done in a container or NPC, 'shape' can
    be SHAPE_ANY = -359 to match any shape.
    ** END IMPORTANT NOTES **

  Return:
    An object reference to the first found object, or zero if no objects match
    the given criteria.

object[] UI_find_nearby(object loc, int shape, int dist, int mask)
object[] loc->find_nearby(int shape, int dist, int mask)
object[] UI_find_nearby(int loc[3], int shape, int dist, int mask)
object[] UI_find_nearby(int loc[5], int shape, int dist, int mask)
object[] UI_find_nearby(mixed loc[4], int shape, int dist, int mask)

    Searches a specified area looking for objects matching a given criteria.

  Parameters:
    loc      The center of the area to be searched. Can be the return of a
             'UI_click_on_item' intrinsic call, an object reference, a (x, y, z)
             position vector or a (x, y, z, quality, frame) vector. For the last
             form, quality can be QUALITY_ANY = -359 and frame can be FRAME_ANY
             = -359 (but there is little point in both being wildcards, as this
             is the default behavior).
    shape    The shape we are looking for. Can be SHAPE_ANY = -359 to match any
             shape.
    dist     Radius (in tiles) of the area to be searched.
    mask     Parameter specifying the classes of objects that can be found.

    The mask value controls what can be found; using the proper mask, you can
    find eggs, barges, invisible or transparent objects with this intrinsic. The
    mask can be the combination (sum) of one or more of the following values:

        MASK_NONE = 0x00               Cannot find eggs, barges, invisible or
                                       transparent objects.
        MASK_NPC = 0x04                Restricts the search to NPCs. Ignored if
                                       a non-wildcard shape is given.
        MASK_NPC2 = 0x08               Restricts the search to NPCs.
        MASK_EGG = 0x10                Allows eggs and barges to be found.
        MASK_INVISIBLE = 0x20          Allows invisible objects that are not in
                                       the avatar's party to be found.
        MASK_PARTY_INVISIBLE = 0x40    Allows invisible party members to be
                                       found
        MASK_TRANLUCENT = 0x80         Allows translucent objects to be found

  Return:
    Array containing all objects of matching the given criteria that are located
    in the specified area. This array is sorted from right to left, closest
    first.

object[] UI_find_nearby_avatar(int shape)

    Searches the area around the avatar looking for other objects of the
    specified shape.

  Parameters:
    shape    The shape we are looking for. Can be SHAPE_ANY = -359 to match any
             shape.

  Return:
    Array containing all objects of the given shape that are located within 192
    tiles of the avatar. This array is sorted from right to left, closest first.
    You cannot find eggs, barges, invisible or transparent objects with this
    intrinsic.

bool UI_npc_nearby(object obj)
bool obj->npc_nearby()

    Finds out if the desired object is on screen and can act. An NPC is
    considered able to act if it is not asleep, paralyzed or dead; other objects
    are always considered able to act. Note that, despite the name, this
    intrincis can also be used for objects.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object or NPC to be checked.

  Return:
    true if the object is in the screen and can act, false otherwise or if the
    supplied parameter is not an object or NPC.

bool UI_npc_nearby2(object obj)                                             [SI]
bool obj->npc_nearby2()

    Finds out if the desired object is nearby. In this context, 'nearby' means
    within 40 tiles of the avatar. Note that, despite the name, this intrinsic
    is valid for all objects, not just NPCs.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object to be checked.

  Return:
    true if the object is within 40 tiles of the avatar, false otherwise.

int UI_count_objects(object obj, int shape, int qual, int frame)

             an NPC or PARTY = -357 to search the whole party.
    shape    The shape we are looking for. Can be SHAPE_ANY = -359 to match any
             shape.
    qual     The quality that is being sought. Can be QUALITY_ANY = -359 to
             match any quality.
    frame    What frame is desired. Can be FRAME_ANY = -359 to match any frame.

  Return:
    The number of objects that match the given criteria.

object[] UI_get_cont_items(object obj, int shape, int qual, int frame)
object[] obj->get_cont_items(int shape, int qual, int frame)

    Looks for all objects matching a given search criteria that are contained in
    the supplied object.

  Parameters:
    obj      The object whose contents are to be searched. Can be a container or
             an NPC.
    shape    The shape we are looking for. Can be SHAPE_ANY = -359 to match any
             shape.
    qual     The quality that is being sought. Can be QUALITY_ANY = -359 to
             match any quality.
    frame    What frame is desired. Can be FRAME_ANY = -359 to match any frame.

  Return:
    Array containing object references to all objects that match the given
    criteria.

================================================================================
PLACEMENT INTRINSICS
================================================================================

    With these intrinsics, you can create, move or delete objects or NPCs,
    whether they are in the game world or in a container.

bool UI_is_not_blocked(int pos[3], int shape, int frame)

    Checks if there is enough room for a given shape in the specified location.

  Parameters:
    pos      The location to be checked.
    shape    The shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' that is to be checked.
    frame    The frame of the given shape that should be checked.

  Return:
    If there is enough room in the given location for an object of the given
    shape and frame, returns true; otherwise, returns false.

actor[] UI_add_party_items(int count, int shape, int qual, int frame, bool temp)

    Creates a specified amount of objects matching the given parameters and
    gives them all to the party. Not all objects requested may be created; in
    particular, this intrinsic is guaranteed to create only as many of the
    requested objects as the party can hold.

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    If the party cannot hold all requested objects, the remaining objects are
    created and then placed in the ground nearby.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

  Parameters:
    count    The amount of objects to be created.
    shape    The shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' that should be used for the created
             objects.
    qual     The quality of the objects being created. Can be QUALITY_ANY = -359
             to create items of any quality.
    frame    What frame will be used for the created objects. Can be FRAME_ANY =
             -359 to create items of any frame.
    temp     Flag indicating whether the created items are temporary or not.

  Return:
    Returns an array of object references for all party members that received
    any of the created objects.

    ****** BG SPECIFIC ******
    The 'temp' flag applies to all objects created by this function.
    **** END BG SPECIFIC ****

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    If any objects were added to the ground, the number of objects on the ground
    is appended to the end of the return array. The 'temp' flag applies only to
    those objects that were added to the floor.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

bool UI_remove_party_items(int count, int shape, int qual, int frame)
bool UI_remove_party_items(int count, int shape, int qual, int frame, bool unk)

    Looks through the party's possessions and deletes a specified amount of
    objects matching a given search criteria. This function is an all-or-nothing
    function: it will delete all requested objects or none at all if it found
    less objects than the amount that was requested for deletion.

  Parameters:
    count    The amount of objects to be deleted. Can be QUANTITY_ANY = -359 to
             delete all objects that match the criteria.
    shape    The shape we are looking for.
    qual     The quality that is being sought. Can be QUALITY_ANY = -359 to
             match any quality.
    frame    What frame is desired. Can be FRAME_ANY = -359 to match any frame.
    unk      Flag of unknown meaning. This parameter is ignored by Exult, and
             can be omitted.

  Return:
    true if 'count' objects were found and deleted, false if no objects were
    deleted.

object UI_summon(int shape)
object UI_summon(int shape, bool unk)

    Creates a monster with shape 'shape'. The created monster has equipment as
    defined in its equipment record, and has a 'FRIENDLY' alignment. If the
    creation is successful, the return value is a reference to the monster;
    otherwise, the return is '0'. In the originals, there was an additional
    'bool' parameter, but it is unimplemented in Exult.

    Creates a monster of the supplied shape. This monster has equipment as
    defined in its equipment record, starts with an IN_COMBAT schedule, and will
    have the same alignment as item; for the cases in which item is not an NPC,
    the summoned monster's alignment will be FRIENDLY instead. The monster will
    be placed within five tiles of the avatar.

  Parameters:
    shape    The shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' to be used for the summoned monster. It
             *must* have a 'monster' tab in Exult Studio.
    unk      A flag of unknown meaning. Exult ignores this flag, and it is safe
             to omit it.

  Return:
    Zero if there is no free tile near the avatar or the specified shape is not
    a valid monster shape; an object reference to the summoned monster
    otherwise.

actor UI_clone(actor npc)
actor npc->clone()

    Creates a duplicate of the supplied NPC. This duplicate is always of
    FRIENDLY alignment and starts with an IN_COMBAT schedule. The clone is
    placed in a spot near to the original NPC.

  Parameters:
    npc    The NPC that should be cloned.

  Return:
    An object reference to the clone, or zero if the intrinsic did not receive a
    valid NPC to clone or if a suitable spot for the clone could not be found.

object UI_create_new_object(int shape)

    Creates a new object with the specified shape.

  Parameters:
    shape    The shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' of the new object. If this is a monster
             shape, the object is created without any equipment whatsoever, even
             if the shape has an associated equipment entry.

  Return:
    An object reference to the newly created object. This object is pushed into
    the 'last created' LIFO stack, and starts out in 'limbo'; it will remain
    there until placed either, in the game world through the
    'UI_update_last_created' intrinsic or inside a container through the
    'UI_give_last_created' intrinsic.

object UI_create_new_object2(int shape, int pos[])                   [SI, Exult]

    Creates a new object with the specified shape and places it in the game
    world at the supplied location.

  Parameters:
    shape    The shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' of the new object. If this is a monster
             shape, the object is created with all equipment specified by the
             shape's equipment entry.
    pos      The location where the new object is to be placed.

    The location can be specified by arrays ranging from 1 to 4 components. The
    meaning of these components is as follows:

    * 1 element: the object will be deleted (equivalent to 'remove_item'
      intrinsic);
    * 2 elements: mean a (x, y) location. The object is placed at z = 0 in the
      current game map;
    * 3 elements: mean a (x, y, z) location. The object is placed in the
      current game map;
    * 4 elements: mean a (x, y, z, map) location. The object is placed in the
      specified map unless it is -1, in which case it will be placed in the
      current game map.

  Return:
    An object reference to the newly created object. This object is placed in
    the game world exactly as if UI_update_last_created(pos) had been called,
    and hence will *not* be in the 'last created' stack.

UI_create_barge_object(int width, int height, int dir)                   [Exult]

    Creates a barge object with the specified width, height and direction.

  Parameters:
    width     The width (x), in tiles, of the barge object.
    height    The height (y), in tiles, of the barge object.
    dir       This optional parameter sets the barge's initial direction. If
              missing, it is assumed to be north (0).

  Return:
    An object reference to the newly created barge object. This object is pushed
    into the 'last created' LIFO stack, and starts out in 'limbo'; it will
    remain there until placed either, in the game world through the
    'UI_update_last_created' intrinsic or inside a container through the
    'UI_give_last_created' intrinsic.

object UI_set_last_created(object obj)
object obj->set_last_created()

    Moves the object from the game map or container where it was and places it
    in the 'last created' stack. This intrinsic does nothing if the specified
    object is already in the aforementioned stack.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object to be moved to the 'last created' stack.

  Return:
    Returns zero if the object was already in the 'last created' stack, an
    object reference to the object otherwise.

    ****** BG SPECIFIC ******
    int UI_update_last_created(int pos[])
    **** END BG SPECIFIC ****

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    object UI_update_last_created(int pos[])
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

    Pops the last object pushed in the 'last created' stack and places it in the
    game map at the supplied position.

  Parameters:
    pos    The location where the new object is to be placed.

    The location can be specified by arrays ranging from 1 to 4 components. The
    meaning of these components is as follows:

    * 1 element: the object will be deleted (equivalent to 'remove_item'
      intrinsic);
    * 2 elements: mean a (x, y) location. The object is placed at z = 0 in the
      current game map;
    * 3 elements: mean a (x, y, z) location. The object is placed in the
      current game map;
    * 4 elements: mean a (x, y, z, map) location. The object is placed in the
      specified map unless it is -1, in which case it will be placed in the
      current game map.

  Return:
    Zero if the 'last created' stack is empty and '1' if the object was deleted.
    Otherwise:

    ****** BG SPECIFIC ******
    If successful, returns 1.
    **** END BG SPECIFIC ****

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    If successful, returns a reference to the object.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

UI_give_last_created(object obj)
obj->give_last_created()

    Gives the last item in the 'last created' stack to the specified container
    or NPC. This intrinsic ignores volume, and is quite likely to succeed; the
    given object is popped from the 'last created' stack only if the intrinsic
    succeeds.

  Parameters:
    obj    Container or NPC that will gain the object.

  Return:
    true if successful, false otherwise.

int[3] UI_get_object_position(object obj)
int[3] obj->get_object_position()

    Gets the current location the desired object.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose position is desired.

  Return:
    An array containing the (x, y, z) position of the object.

UI_move_object(object obj, int pos[], bool flag)
obj->move_object(int pos[], bool flag)

    Moves the specified object to a new location in the game world. This move is
    instantaneous, and is often used for teleportation in the original usecode.

  Parameters:
    obj     The object to be moved. Can be PARTY = -357 to teleport the entire
            party.
    pos     The object's new location. Can be a (x, y) position, a (x, y, z)
            position or a (x, y, z, map) position. If no z coordinate is
            specified, it is assumed to be zero. If no map is specified, or if
            it is set to a negative number, the avatar's map will be used
            instead.
    flag    This optional parameter controls controls whether or party members
            that are paralyzed or asleep; if true, these members will be
            teleported, otherwise, they won't defaults to false.

    If the avatar (or the party) is being teleported, the view will center in
    the new location and nearby eggs will be activated normally.

int UI_get_distance(object obj1, object obj2)
int obj1->get_distance(obj2)

    Gets the distance between two objects.

  Parameters:
    obj1    One of the two objects.
    obj2    The other object.

  Return:
    The distance between the two objects, or zero if one or both of the
    parameters is not a valid object.

int UI_find_direction(object param1, object param2)
int param1->find_direction(object param2)
int UI_find_direction(object param1, int param2[3])
int param1->find_direction(int param2[3])
int UI_find_direction(object param1, mixed param2[4])
int param1->find_direction(mixed param2[4])
int UI_find_direction(int param1[3], object param2)
int UI_find_direction(int param1[3], int param2[3])
int UI_find_direction(int param1[3], mixed param2[4])
int UI_find_direction(mixed param1[4], object param2)
int UI_find_direction(mixed param1[4], int param2[3])
int UI_find_direction(mixed param1[4], mixed param2[4])

    Get the direction from one location or object to another.

    This intrinsic is aliased under the name 'direction_from'; they are both
    equivalent in Exult.

  Parameters:
    param1    The object or location *from* which we want the direction.
    param2    The object or location *to* which we want the direction.

    Both parameters can be objects, arrays with 3 components or arrays with 4
    components. Depending on what they are, Exult will treat them differently
    and expect them to conform to a certain format; specifically:

        Type         Interpretation/Format
        object       The parameter is an object or NPC.
        int [3]      The parameter is a (x, y, z) position, such as the return
                     of a UI_get_object_position intrinsic call.
        mixed [4]    The parameter is of the form (object, x, y, z), such as the
                     return of a call to UI_click_on_item intrinsic.

  Return:
    The 8-cardinal-point direction of an arrow starting in the first parameter
    and pointing to the second parameter. It can be one of the following values:

        NORTH    = 0    NORTHEAST    = 1    EAST    = 2    SOUTHEAST    = 3
        SOUTH    = 4    SOUTHWEST    = 5    WEST    = 6    NORTHWEST    = 7

int UI_add_cont_items(object obj, int count, int shape, int          [SI, Exult]
        qual, int frame, bool temp)
int obj->add_cont_items(int count, int shape, int qual, int frame, bool temp)

    Create a number of objects inside a container.

  Parameters:
    obj      The container or NPC that will receive the created objects.
    count    The amount of objects to be created.
    shape    The shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' that should be used for the created
             objects.
    qual     The quality of the objects being created. Can be QUALITY_ANY = -359
             to create items of any quality.
    frame    What frame will be used for the created objects. Can be FRAME_ANY =
             -359 to create items of any frame.
    temp     Flag indicating whether the created items are temporary or not.

  Return:
    How many objects were actually added to the container.

int UI_remove_cont_items(object obj, int count, int shape,           [SI, Exult]
        int qual, int frame, bool unk)
int obj->remove_cont_items(int count, int shape, int qual, int frame, bool unk)

    Removes 'count' objects with shape 'shape', quality 'qual' and frame 'frame'
    that are contained by 'obj'. 'unk' is an unknown flag which is ignored by
    Exult; I *think* it is safe to omit it from the parameter list, but I am not
    sure. 'qual' and 'frame' can be wildcards:

        qual                     frame
        QUALITY_ANY    = -359    FRAME_ANY      = -359

    Return value is the number of objects actually removed.

    Looks through the contents of a container and deletes a specified amount of
    objects matching a given search criteria.

  Parameters:
    obj      The object whose contents are to be searched. Can be a container,
             an NPC or PARTY = -357 to search the whole party.
    count    The amount of objects to be deleted. Can be QUANTITY_ANY = -359 to
             delete all objects that match the criteria.
    shape    The shape we are looking for.
    qual     The quality that is being sought. Can be QUALITY_ANY = -359 to
             match any quality.
    frame    What frame is desired. Can be FRAME_ANY = -359 to match any frame.
    unk      Flag of unknown meaning. This parameter is ignored by Exult, and
             can be omitted.

    quantity, quality or current frame.

int UI_get_item_shape(object obj)
int obj->get_item_shape()

    Gets the current shape of the desired object.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose shape is desired.

  Return:
    The shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' of the object in question.

UI_set_item_shape(object obj, int shape)
obj->set_item_shape(int shape)

    Changes the shape of an object.

int obj->get_item_frame()

    Gets the current frame of the desired object, *without* the rotation bit.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose frame is desired.

  Return:
    The frame from 'SHAPES.VGA' of the object in question. Only the base frame
    is returned, without any rotation information.

UI_set_item_frame(object obj, int frame)
obj->set_item_frame(int frame)

    Sets the current frame of the desired object, preserving the rotation bit.

  Parameters:
    obj      The object whose frame is to be changed.
    frame    The desired value for the frame.

int UI_get_item_frame_rot(object obj)
int obj->get_item_frame_rot()

    Gets the current frame of the desired object, *with* the rotation bit.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose frame is desired.

  Return:
    The frame from 'SHAPES.VGA' of the object in question; including the
    rotation bit.

UI_set_item_frame_rot(object obj, int frame)
obj->set_item_frame_rot(int frame)

    Sets the current frame of the desired object; does *not* preserve the
    rotation bit.

  Parameters:
    obj      The object whose frame is to be changed.
    frame    The desired value for the frame.

int UI_get_item_quality(object obj)
int obj->get_item_quality()

    Gets the quality of the desired object.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose quality is desired.

  Return:
    The quality of the object if it has it, zero otherwise.

bool UI_set_item_quality(object obj, int qual)
bool obj->set_item_quality(int qual)

    Sets the quality of the desired object.

  Parameters:
    obj     The object whose quality is to be changed.
    qual    The desired value for the quality. Quality is unchanged if qual ==
            QUALITY_ANY.

  Return:
    Returns true if the object has a quality or if qual == QUALITY_ANY, false
    otherwise.

int UI_get_item_quantity(object obj)
int obj->get_item_quantity()
int UI_get_item_quantity(object obj, int unk)
int obj->get_item_quantity(int unk)

    Gets the quantity of the desired object.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose quantity is desired.
    unk    An unknown parameter from the original games. Can be omitted if
           desired, as Exult does not use it.

    The quantity of the object if it has it, '1' otherwise.

bool UI_set_item_quantity(object obj, int quant)
bool obj->set_item_quantity(int quant)

    Sets the quantity of the desired object. The object's quantity is changed
    only if the object has it.

  Parameters:
    obj      The object whose quantity is to be changed.
    quant    The desired value for the quantity. If this value is zero, the
             object will be deleted unless it is not in the game map -- likely
             because it has been created by Usecode but not yet placed.

  Return:
    Returns true if the object has a quantity, false otherwise.

int UI_get_lift(object obj)
int obj->get_lift()

    Gets how far above the ground the object is.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose lift is desired.

    The flag parameter is a numeric value describing a (usually boolean) bit of
    information about the object in question. Valid pre-defined values for the
    flag are:

        INVISIBLE           = 0    Object is invisible (rendered with
                                   'invisible' palette, or not at all).

        POISONED            = 8    Object is afflicted with poison. Can be set
                                   on objects, but will only do anything to
                                   NPCs.
        PROTECTION          = 9    Object is protected from harm. Only really

                                   and certain critical NPCs (such as L.B.). Can
                                   be inspected only.
        DANCING            = 15    Object is executing the usecode called by the

                                   at all.
        SI_ON_MOVING_BARGE = 17    SI: Object is on a special instance of the SI
                                   barges. (Turtle for example.)
        TEMPORARY          = 18    Object is temporary and will decay once the
                                   chunk it is in is un-cached.
        SAILOR             = 20    Object is the 'captain' of a barge. *Only set
                                   on NPCs!*
        OKAY_TO_LAND       = 21    Set in usecode for flying carpet, TRUE if you
                                   can land currently.
        BG_DONT_MOVE       = 22    BG: BG's version of DONT_MOVE.
        SI_DONT_RENDER     = 22    SI: SI's version of DONT_RENDER.
        IN_DUNGEON         = 23    If set on PC or an NPC, they won't trigger
                                   the stealing usecode if they take food
                                   objects.
        CONFUSED           = 25    This will be set if the avatar failed
                                   copyright protection questions in SI. Only
                                   really meaningful used on the avatar.
        IN_MOTION          = 26    Object is a barge object moving, or on a
                                   barge object that is moving. Set in usecode,
                                   and mostly used for the SI 'NPC' ships such
                                   as the turtle.
        MET                = 28    Object has been talked to previously. Should
                                   be set in a conversation Usecode script. This
                                   determines conversation behavior, and whether
                                   the NPC's real name or shape name is
                                   displayed when they are single-clicked on. BG
                                   originally used global flags for this, which
                                   amounts to an extra 250-odd flags. What a
                                   waste of time.
        SI_TOURNAMENT      = 29    Literal plot immunity: the NPC can die only
                                   if the plot allows it. If enough damage is
                                   taken in a single blow, the object will call
                                   usecode (eventid = 7) on death. Used for the
                                   List Field in SI.
        SI_ZOMBIE          = 30    Object will not respond to normal cues. Used
                                   for sick Neyobi, insane party members/Cantra.
        NO_SPELL_CASTING   = 31    Object cannot cast spells. Set when the
                                   magebane strikes the object.
        POLYMORPH          = 32    Object is polymorphed.
        TATTOOED           = 33    Object has been tattooed. Set after the lady
                                   tattoos you by usecode. Causes the avatar
                                   portraits to use a different 'tattooed' shape
                                   num.
        READ               = 34    Object can read serpent- or rune-script text.
                                   Only really meaningful used on the avatar.
        PETRA              = 35    Object has switched bodies with petra. This
                                   changes the portraits of NPCs according to a
                                   list in the 'avatar_data.txt' file. Only
                                   really meaningful for NPCs in that list.
        FLIGHT             = 36    Object can fly. Only really useful for NPCs.
        FREEZE             = 37    Object is freezing. Only really useful for
                                   NPCs.
        NAKED              = 38    Object is naked. On the avatar, causes
                                   him/her to use the appropriate 'naked' shape.
                                   On other NPCs there no effect. To actually
                                   make NPCs naked, use set_polymorph instead.

  Return:
    For most flags, true if the flag is set (that is, in effect), false
    otherwise. There is one exception, however: The 'SAILOR' flag has a peculiar
    behavior in that it actually returns an object reference to the last object
    to have that flag set, or zero if no object has been set or if the flag has
    been cleared with 'clear_item_flag' intrinsic.

    With the exception of the OKAY_TO_TAKE, TEMPORARY and INVISIBLE flags, these
    flags are valid for NPCs only. You can get, set or clear any of those values
    and Exult will not complain; however, it will also not save the values of
    the flags except for the three mentioned before. Moreover, the INVISIBLE
    flag will not be saved for objects unless they are of 'quality flags' class.

UI_set_item_flag(object obj, int flag)
obj->set_item_flag(int flag)

    Sets the desired flag for the given object. Many flags have immediate
    effects when set; most do not. See the get_item_flag intrinsic for flag
    values.

  Parameters:
    obj     The object whose flag we wish to set. Not all flags are available
            for all objects.
    flag    What flag we want to set. This is a number in the 0 to 63 range; it
            can be any of the values for the 'flag' parameter of the
            set_item_flag intrinsic.

    In the special case of the 'SAILOR' flag, the supplied object, instead of a
    flag value. This stored object will be returned by future calls of the
    'get_item_flag' intrinsic.

    With the exception of the OKAY_TO_TAKE, TEMPORARY and INVISIBLE flags, these
    flags are valid for NPCs only. You can get, set or clear any of those values
    and Exult will not complain; however, it will also not save the values of
    the flags except for the three mentioned before. Moreover, the INVISIBLE
    flag will not be saved for objects unless they are of 'quality flags' class.

UI_clear_item_flag(object obj, int flag)
obj->clear_item_flag(int flag)

    Clears the desired flag for the given object. Many flags have immediate
    effects when cleared; most do not. See the get_item_flag intrinsic for flag
    values.

  Parameters:
    obj     The object whose flag we wish to clear. Not all flags are available
            for all objects.
    flag    What flag we want to clear. This is a number in the 0 to 63 range;
            it can be any of the values for the 'flag' parameter of the
            set_item_flag intrinsic.

    In the special case of the 'SAILOR' flag, the object that it stores is set
    to zero. This will be the return of any future calls to the 'get_item_flag'
    intrinsic.

    With the exception of the OKAY_TO_TAKE, TEMPORARY and INVISIBLE flags, these
    flags are valid for NPCs only. You can get, set or clear any of those values
    and Exult will not complain; however, it will also not save the values of
    the flags except for the three mentioned before. Moreover, the INVISIBLE
    flag will not be saved for objects unless they are of 'quality flags' class.

object UI_get_barge(object obj)
object obj->get_barge()

    Checks the barge upon which the supplied object is on.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object to be inspected.

  Return:
    Returns zero if no valid object is passed, or if the object is not lying on
    a barge. Otherwise, returns the object reference of the barge (shape 961)
    object upon which the supplied object lies.

UI_set_barge_dir(object obj, int dir)                                [SI, Exult]
obj->set_barge_dir(int dir)

    If 'obj' is a barge object, sets its direction (along with all objects
    laying on 'obj') to 'dir'. 'dir' can be one of the constants defined for
    'find_direction' intrinsic.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object to be animated.
    dir    The 8-cardinal-point direction that the barge should face. This can
           be one of the values returned by the find_direction intrinsic.

bool UI_on_barge()

    Determines if the entire party is inside the same barge as the avatar.

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    In SI, this intrinsic also forces the barge to refresh the list of all
    objects lying on it.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

  Return:
    If the avatar is on a barge and all party members are on that same barge,
    returns true; in all other cases, returns false.

object UI_get_container(object obj)
object obj->get_container()

    Gets the container of the supplied object.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose container is desired.

    reference to its immediate container otherwise.

UI_remove_item(object obj)
obj->remove_item()

    Removes the object from the game world and from the 'last created' stack. If
    the object is not an NPC, it will de deleted; NPCs will still exist.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object to be deleted.

int UI_get_usecode_fun(object obj)                                       [Exult]
int obj->get_usecode_fun()

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose usecode function we desire.

  Return:
    The usecode function number that is assigned to the object.

bool UI_is_on_keyring(int qual)                                             [SI]

    Checks if a key is in the keyring. Note that the keyring is a global object;
    multiple keyrings will share the same list of keys.

  Parameters:
    qual    The quality of the key to be checked.

  Return:
    true if the key is on the keyring, false otherwise.

UI_add_to_keyring(int qual)                                                 [SI]

    Causes random damage of a given type to the desired object, subject to
    armor.

  Parameters:
    base    The 'strength' of the attack; only one third of this value (rounded
            down) is used to deal damage. This parameter is ignored depending on
            damage type; specifically, damage of LIGHTNING_DAMAGE type ignores
            this parameter.
    hits    The 'weapon points' of the attack. If this parameter is equal to 127
            or more, this intrinsic will ignore all armor and deal a fixed 127
            points of damage of the specified type, ignoring the 'base'
            parameter.
    type    The type of the damage. If the target is immune to this damage type,
            he will take no damage from this intrinsic; conversely, a monster
            vulnerable to this type of damage takes doubled damage.
            Armor-granted immunities also protect the target from the effects of
            this intrinsic. If the damage type is LIGHTNING_DAMAGE,
            ETHEREAL_DAMAGE or SONIC_DAMAGE, this intrinsic will ignore armor.
    obj     The object to be damaged.

    The type of the damage is a numerical value that describes what kind of
    damage should be caused. It can be one of the following values:

        NORMAL_DAMAGE = 0       Normal damage.
        FIRE_DAMAGE = 1         Damage from heat sources.
        MAGIC_DAMAGE = 2        Damage from a magical source.
        LIGHTNING_DAMAGE = 3    Damage from electrical sources such as
                                lightning. Extremely painful, even a single
                                point of damage causes the screen to flash a red
                                color. This damage ignores all armor and does
                                not depend on the attacker's strength.
        ETHEREAL_DAMAGE = 4     Special magical damage, basically magic damage
                                not blocked by normal magic resistance or armor.
        SONIC_DAMAGE = 5        Sound-based damage. This damage type ignores
                                armor.

    The damage is calculated from a series of generated random numbers. It
    proceeds along the following steps:

        * If the target is wearing any armor that makes him/her immune to the
          specified damage type, he takes no damage from this intrinsic.
        * If hits is 127 or more, 127 points of damage are caused to the
          target. This case ignores all armor.
        * If base/3 (rounded down) is zero, it does not affect damage;
          likewise, if hits is zero, it does not affect damage. A random number
          will be generated for each of them that are nonzero, ranging from 1 to
          base/3 or from 1 to hits, as appropriate. These two random numbers are
          added together.
        * If the damage type does not ignore armor, the armor value of
          everything worn by the target is computed. Monster-specified armor
          values are also added to this value. If the total armor is at least
          zero, a random number in the range 1 to (total armor) is generated and
          subtracted from the damage total above.
        * If the target has immunities granted by his monster data, he will
          take no damage; if he has any vulnerabilities, the remaining damage,
          if positive, will be doubled.

  Return:
    Returns true if any damage is caused on a valid target, false otherwise.

UI_reduce_health(object obj, int hits, int type)
obj->reduce_health(int hits, int type)

    Causes a fixed amount of damage of the specified type to a target. This
    intrinsic ignores armor and armor-granted immunities.

  Parameters:
    obj     The object to be damaged.
    hits    How much damage is to be caused.
    type    The type of the damage. If the target is immune to this damage type,
            he will take no damage from this intrinsic; conversely, a monster
            vulnerable to this type of damage takes doubled damage.
            Armor-granted immunities are ignored.

    The type of the damage is a numerical value that describes what kind of
    damage should be caused. It can be one of the following values:

        NORMAL_DAMAGE = 0       Normal damage.
        FIRE_DAMAGE = 1         Damage from heat sources.
        MAGIC_DAMAGE = 2        Damage from a magical source.
        LIGHTNING_DAMAGE = 3    Damage from electrical sources such as
                                lightning. Extremely painful, even a single
                                point of damage causes the screen to flash a red
                                color. This damage ignores all armor and does
                                not depend on the attacker's strength.
        ETHEREAL_DAMAGE = 4     Special magical damage, basically magic damage
                                not blocked by normal magic resistance or armor.
        SONIC_DAMAGE = 5        Sound-based damage. This damage type ignores
                                armor.

int UI_attack_object(object attacker, object target, int weapon)
int attacker->attack_object(object target, int weapon)

    Causes a NPC to attack the object with a given weapon. This intrinsic does
    not animate the NPC in any way; it only emulates a hit with the selected
    weapon.

  Parameters:
    attacker    Who is attacking.
    target      What is being attacked. Must be an object or NPC.
    weapon      What shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' to use as the source of the weapon
                information in the attack, or -1 for an unarmed attack. If this
                is a missile or thrown weapon, it will consume the appropriate
                ammunition (if any) and fire the correct projectile.

    If the NPC is targeting a tile, the attack will only be meaningful if the
    weapon causes an explosion.

  Return:
    true if a melee attack hits or if a ranged attack fires its projectile;
    returns false if the melee attack missed or if the attack could not be
    realized for any reason (including an invalid attacker, an invalid target,
    being out of range, lack of adequate ammunition for the given weapon) if
    attacking a valid target with a valid weapon, false otherwise.

UI_fire_projectile(object obj, int dir, int proj, int attpts, int weapon, int
        ammo)
obj->fire_projectile(int dir, int proj, int weapon, int ammo)

    Causes the given object to fire a high-speed missile in the supplied
    direction.

  Parameters:
    obj       The object that will fire the projectile.
    dir       Numeric value indicating the direction in which the projectile
              will be fired.
    proj      The shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' of the projectile to be fired.
    attpts    Numeric value determining the likelihood that the missile will
              hit. Works like the 'att' parameter in the roll_to_win intrinsic
              in a contest against the target's COMBAT property.
    weapon    The shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' whose weapon information will be used
              when the missile hits.
    ammo      The shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' whose ammunition information will be
              used when the missile hits.

    The direction into which the projectile is filed is the 8-cardinal-point
    direction in which the projectile will travel. It can be one of the
    following values:

        NORTH    = 0    NORTHEAST    = 1    EAST    = 2    SOUTHEAST    = 3
        SOUTH    = 4    SOUTHWEST    = 5    WEST    = 6    NORTHWEST    = 7

int npc->get_schedule_type()

    Gets the current schedule of an NPC.

  Parameters:
    npc    The NPC whose schedule is desired.

  Return:
    Zero if 'npc' is not a valid NPC; otherwise, an integer associated to the
    NPC's current schedule. This is the same value that is reported in the cheat
    screen, and can be one of the following values:

        IN_COMBAT    = 0     PACE_HORIZONTAL    = 1     PACE_VERTICAL    = 2
        TALK         = 3     DANCE              = 4     EAT              = 5

        DESK_WORK    = 30    FOLLOW_AVATAR      = 31    

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    If the NPC is traversing a path created by a call to either,
    UI_path_run_usecode or UI_si_path_run_usecode intrinsics, this intrinsic
    will return the value WALK_TO_SCHEDULE = 32 instead of the values above.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

UI_set_schedule_type(actor npc, int sched)
npc->set_schedule_type(int sched)

    Gets the current schedule of an NPC.

  Parameters:
    npc      The NPC whose schedule we wish to change.
    sched    The new schedule type. Can be any of the values listed as the
             return of a get_schedule_type intrinsic call.

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
     The SI-specific value WALK_TO_SCHEDULE = 32 *cannot* be set with this
    intrinsic; only a call to either, UI_path_run_usecode or
    UI_si_path_run_usecode intrinsics can do that.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

UI_modify_schedule(actor npc, int time, int sched, int               [SI, Exult]
        pos[2])
npc->modify_schedule(int time, int sched, int pos[2])

    Changes the schedule table of an NPC for the desired time period. This new
    schedule is persistent across save games. The NPC will execute his/her new
    schedule in the map he/she currently resides when the time comes.

  Parameters:
    npc      The NPC whose schedule table is to be changed.
    time     An integer specifying the time period of the new schedule. Must be
             an integer in the 0-7 range, such as those returned by the
             part_of_day intrinsic.
    sched    An integer specifying the new schedule. Must be an integer in the
             0-31 range, such as those returned by the get_schedule_type
             intrinsic.
    loc      A (x, y) location, specifying the location of the new schedule.

UI_set_new_schedules(actor npc, int time, int sched, int             [SI, Exult]
        loc[2])
UI_set_new_schedules(actor npc, int time[n], int sched[n], int loc[2n])
npc->set_new_schedules(int time, int sched, int loc[2])
npc->set_new_schedules(int time[n], int sched[n], int loc[2n])

    Changes the schedule table of an NPC. This new schedule table is persistent
    across save games. The NPC will execute his/her new schedules in the map
    he/she currently resides.

  Parameters:
    npc      The NPC whose schedule table is to be changed.
    time     An integer, or array of integers, specifying the time periods of
             the new schedules. Each element of the array is an integer in the
             0-7 range, such as those returned by the part_of_day intrinsic.
    sched    An integer, or array of schedules, specifying the new schedules.
             There must be one such schedule for each time period supplied in
             the 'time' parameter. Each element of this array is an integer in
             the 0-31 range, such as those returned by the get_schedule_type
             intrinsic.
    loc      An array of (x, y) positions, specifying the new schedule
             locations. This array must have a (x, y) location for each time
             period supplied in the 'time' parameter.

UI_run_schedule(actor npc)                                           [SI, Exult]
npc->run_schedule()

npc->revert_schedule()

    Reverts the schedules of a NPC to those stored in 'STATIC/schedule.dat'. Can
    be risky for NPCs not in the original games.

  Parameters:
    npc    The NPC whose schedule is to be reset.

int UI_get_npc_prop(object obj, int prop)
int UI_get_npc_prop(object obj, string prop)
int obj->get_npc_prop(int prop)
int obj->get_npc_prop(string prop)

    Gets the current value of an object's or NPC's property. Despite the name,
    this intrinsic can also be called for any object, although most properties
    will be unavailable for anything but NPCs.

  Parameters:
    obj     The object or NPC whose property is desired.
    prop    String or integer specifying the property to be inspected.

    If the desired property has been specified as an integer, it must be in the
    range from 0 to 11. It can be one of the following values:

        STRENGTH     = 0    DEXTERITY    = 1     INTELLIGENCE      = 2
        HEALTH       = 3    COMBAT       = 4     MANA              = 5
        MAX_MANA     = 6    TRAINING     = 7     EXPERIENCE        = 8
        FOODLEVEL    = 9    SEX_FLAG     = 10    MISSILE_WEAPON    = 11

  Return:
    Returns the current value of the specified property. The following
    properties are special cases:

    HEALTH            This is the only meaningful property for non-NPC objects.
                      Returns the current remaining hit points of the object or
                      NPC.
    SEX_FLAG          The return is true if the NPC is female, false otherwise.
    MISSILE_WEAPON    The return is true if the NPC is using a missile weapon or
                      a good thrown weapon (such as a spear), false otherwise.

    This intrinsic returns zero for any property which is not meaningful for the
    supplied object; this includes string properties that have not been
    previously set with a UI_set_npc_prop intrinsic call.

    ****** BG SPECIFIC ******
    Standard BG does not have sex data for anyone but the avatar, so the return
    is almost always 'false'. This is not a limitation of the engine or of
    Exult, just a statement about the game data.
    **** END BG SPECIFIC ****

UI_set_npc_prop(object obj, int prop, int delta)
UI_set_npc_prop(object obj, string prop, int delta)
obj->set_npc_prop(int prop, int delta)
obj->set_npc_prop(string prop, int delta)

    Changes an object's or NPC's property by the specified value. Despite the
    name, this intrinsic can also be called for any object, although most
    properties will be unavailable for anything but NPCs.

  Parameters:
    obj      The object or NPC whose property is to be changed.
    prop     String or integer specifying the property to be changed.
    delta    The desired numeric *change* in the specified property.

    If the desired property has been specified as an integer, it must be one of
    the values listed in the UI_get_npc_prop intrinsic description. The
    following values are special cases:

    HEALTH            This is the only meaningful property for non-NPC objects.
                      Changes the remaining hit points of the object or NPC. If
                      the remaining hit points become zero, an object will
                      become *indestructible*.
    EXPERIENCE        This property is changed by /half/ of the specified value.
    SEX_FLAG          A nonzero 'delta' sets the NPC to female, while a zero
                      'delta' sets the NPC to male.
    MISSILE_WEAPON    Nothing happens when this property value is supplied.

    ****** BG SPECIFIC ******
    In the original BG, you could not set the sex flag except by hex-editing the
    game data. Exult does not suffer from this limitation.
    **** END BG SPECIFIC ****

    If the desired property has been specified as a string, it will be created
    if it does not exist; its initial value is assumed to be zero in this case.
    Only NPCs can have such properties, and they will be displayed in the NPC's
    stats window.

  Return:
    Always returns '0'.

string UI_get_npc_name(object obj)
string obj->get_npc_name()
string[] UI_get_npc_name(object obj[])

    Gets the name of one or more objects. Despite the name, this intrinsic can
    be called for any object, not just NPCs; for non-NPCs, the return is the
    text displayed when you click the object.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object, or array of objects, whose names are desired.

  Return:
    If the input is an array of objects, the return is an array with the names
    of these objects. The output array places the object names in the same order
    as the objects are in the input array.

    Otherwise, the return is the name of the given object.

UI_set_npc_name(actor npc, string name)

int UI_get_npc_number(actor npc)
int npc->get_npc_number()

  Parameters:
    npc    The NPC whose number is desired. This is intended to receive an
           object reference, but accepts integers as normal.

  Return:
    The NPC's number. This is a negative number for all 'true' NPCs, -356 for
    the avatar, 1 for monsters or zero for anything that is not a valid NPC.

int UI_get_alignment(actor npc)
int npc->get_alignment()

    Gets the NPC's attitude towards the avatar.

    id     The new identity value. Must be an integer in the 0-31 range; values
           outside this range are accepted but incorrectly saved.

actor UI_get_oppressor(actor npc)                                    [SI, Exult]
actor npc->get_oppressor()

    Gets whoever is attacking the supplied NPC. This oppressor can be set
    through usecode, but it is also automatically set to whomever has last
    attacked (caused damage to) the supplied NPC. It is also set whenever an NPC
    acquires a new target -- this NPC will be set as its target's oppressor.

  Parameters:
    npc    The NPC whose oppressor is desired.

  Return:
    Returns the NPC number of the supplied NPC's oppressor, or zero if no valid
    NPC was supplied. The return value has the opposite sign from what you get
    from a get_npc_number intrinsic call.

UI_set_oppressor(actor npc, actor opp)                               [SI, Exult]

  Parameters:
    npc    The NPC whose oppressor is to be changed.
    opp    The NPC that is to be the new oppressor, which must be distinct from
           the NPC we are altering. Must be a true NPC; an egg- or usecode-
           spawned monster has no real NPC number in Exult, and cannot be an
           oppressor.

    an object reference to the object that resides in the desired spot.

bool UI_is_readied(actor npc, int spot, int shape, int frame)
npc->is_readied(int spot, int shape, int frame)

    Returns 'true' if an object with shape 'shape' and frame 'frame' is readied
    in ready spot 'spot' of 'npc', 'false' otherwise. 'frame' can be the
    wildcard 'FRAME_ANY'. Valid values for 'spot' are:

    For SI, it is better to use 'get_readied' intrinsic instead.

    Checks to see if the given NPC is wearing a piece of equipment on a
    specified location.

  Parameters:
    npc      The NPC whose equipment is to be inspected.
    spot     The spot we are checking.

    shape in 'SHAPES.VGA' of the weapon being used.

UI_set_opponent(actor npc, object obj)
npc->set_opponent(object obj)

    Makes the supplied NPC target the desired object. This does not make the NPC
    attack unless his schedule is IN_COMBAT. This intrinsic will reevaluate if
    the NPC's oppressor is actually attacking him, and will invalidate the
    oppressor if not.

  Parameters:
    npc    The NPC whose opponent we wish to set.
    obj    What the target should be set to. If the target is an NPC, his/her
           oppressor will be set to the attacking NPC.

UI_sit_down(actor npc, object obj)

    seated.

  Parameters:
    npc    The NPC that is going to sit down.
    obj    The chair that should be sat upon.

     If the chair is shape 292 (a barge seat), if there is a barge containing

actor UI_resurrect(object obj)
actor obj->resurrect()

    Brings a dead body back to life. If 'obj' is the body of an NPC, resurrects
    the NPC and returns a reference to the NPC; otherwise, returns a null ('0')
    reference.

  Parameters:
    obj    The body that is to be resurrected. Monsters cannot be brought back
           to life in this manner, so it must be the body of a true NPC. This
           body will be deleted after the usecode ends, and all of its contents
           will be transferred to the resurrected NPC.

  Return:
    Zero if the supplied object was not the body of an NPC, otherwise an object
    reference to the resurrected NPC.

bool UI_approach_avatar(actor npc, int unk1, int unk2)
bool npc->approach_avatar(int unk1, int unk2)

    Makes a NPC approach the avatar at fairly high speed.

    *Warning:* If the NPC is initially at more than 10 tiles from the avatar,
    Exult will let him/her walk for about 1/5 seconds before returning,
    effectively halting the game in the mean time.

    *NOTICE:* In the original, this intrinsic *seems:* to create the NPC
    off-screen, while it approaches the avatar due to si_path_run_usecode or the
    'TALK' schedule. This requires further investigation; this means that *this
    intrinsic is subject to change*.

  Parameters:
    npc     Who should approach the avatar.
    unk1    Unknown parameter from the original. Exult does not use this
            parameter, but *this is subject to change*. Ignore this parameter at
            your own peril.
    unk2    Unknown parameter from the original. Exult does not use this
            parameter, but *this is subject to change*. Ignore this parameter at
            your own peril.

  Return:
    false if the NPC is dead or cannot reach the avatar, true otherwise.

UI_call_guards()                                                            [BG]

obj->save_pos()

    Saves the current position/map of an object. This persists across save
    games, but there is only one 'slot' in which the position is saved.
    Therefore, only the last stored position is available.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose position we want.

UI_teleport_to_saved_pos(object obj, bool flag)                      [SI, Exult]
obj->teleport_to_saved_pos(bool flag)

    Teleports the avatar and party to the last saved position. Note that only
    the last position stored by the UI_save_pos intrinsic is available.

  Parameters:
    obj     If this is not the avatar, nothing happens. Otherwise, the party is
            teleported to the stored position.
    flag    This optional parameter controls controls whether or party members
            that are paralyzed or asleep; if true, these members will be
            teleported, otherwise, they won't defaults to false.

================================================================================
WEATHER/TIME INTRINSICS

  Parameters:
    timer    Numeric value indicating the timer to be inspected.

  Return:
    If the specified timer has been initialized by a previous call to
    'UI_set_timer' intrinsic, the return is the number of hours since the
    initialization (or reinitialization) of the timer. Uninitialized timers
    return a random number in the 0-12 hour range.

UI_nap_time(object obj)
obj->nap_time()

    Makes the avatar lay down to sleep in the specified bed. What constitutes a
    bed is currently hard-coded (as of 2009/02/27). Once the avatar reaches the
    bed, Exult will call usecode function 0x622. If the bed is occupied, causes
    one of the party members to pop up and say so.

  Parameters:
    obj    The bed where the avatar should sleep. This bed should be unoccupied.

UI_advance_time(int amount)

    Advances the game time forward.

  Parameters:
    amount    Number of game ticks that should be advanced; 25 ticks are equal

      OVERCAST = 5         Light cloud cover.
      CLOUDY = 6           Heavy cloud cover.

UI_set_weather(int type)

    Modifies the current weather to the desired type. The new weather lasts for
    15 game minutes.

  Parameters:

            the values returned by UI_get_weather intrinsic.

================================================================================
USER INTERFACE INTRINSICS
================================================================================

    With these intrinsics, you can ask the user for input or display feedback
    for his actions.

mixed[4] UI_click_on_item()

    Displays the targeting square and waits for the player to click on
    something.

  Return:
    An array with 4 elements. The first element is the object clicked, or zero
    if the player clicked a tile; the remaining 3 elements make up the (x, y, z)
    location of the object or tile clicked.

    If used after a 'set_intercept_item' intrinsic call, the preassigned object
    or tile is returned in the same manner as if the player had clicked it.

    This intrinsic has a special case: when event == WEAPON (weapon hit), and if
    item is a valid object, the return will be overridden to be it (although a
    'set_intercept_item' intrinsic call takes precedence over this special
    case).

UI_set_intercept_item(object obj)                                        [Exult]
obj->set_intercept_item()
UI_set_intercept_item(int obj[2])
UI_set_intercept_item(int obj[3])
UI_set_intercept_item(mixed obj[4])

    Preassigns the return of the next 'UI_click_on_item' intrinsic' call.

  Parameters:
    obj    What we want to set the return of the next the next
           'UI_click_on_item' intrinsic' call to. Can be an object reference, a
           location (2 or 3 coordinates) or even the return of another
           'UI_click_on_item' intrinsic' call.

int UI_input_numeric_value(int min, int max, int step, int default)

    Prompts the player for numerical input with the bar slider.

  Parameters:
    min        The lowest number allowed.
    max        The highest number allowed.
    step       The distance between any two consecutive numbers that can be
               chosen.
    default    The initial value selected; this value is forced to conform to
               the boundaries specified above.

  Return:
    The number chosen by the player.

bool UI_mouse_exists()

    Determines if a mouse exists.

  Return:
    Exult always returns true; the original games will return true if a mouse if
    present, false otherwise.

UI_flash_mouse(int cursor)

    Momentarily changes the mouse cursor to another shape.

  Parameters:
    cursor    Numeric parameter indicating what the new shape will be. Valid
              values are:

        CURSOR_X              = 1    CURSOR_OUT_OF_RANGE    = 2
        CURSOR_OUT_OF_AMMO    = 3    CURSOR_TOO_HEAVY       = 4
        CURSOR_WONT_FIT       = 5    

UI_ambient_light(bool onoff)                                         [SI, Exult]

    Toggles on or off a permanent version of the light spell.

  Parameters:
    onoff    Flag specifying whether we want to turn the light on or off: true
             to turn it on, false to turn it off.

UI_cause_light(int length)

    Creates a light which illuminates the screen.

  Parameters:
    length    How long the created light will last. The duration is in game
              minutes.

UI_infravision(actor npc, bool onoff)                                [SI, Exult]
npc->infravision(bool onoff)

    Toggles infravision for the given NPC.

  Parameters:
    npc      The NPC that should have infravision toggled. This intrinsic has
             effect only for party members.
    onoff    Flag specifying whether we want infravision or not: true to turn it
             on, false to turn it off.

UI_set_light(object obj, bool onoff)
obj->set_light(bool onoff)

    Marks the given light source as being added to or removed from its
    containing NPC.

  Parameters:
    obj      The light source that is being added or removed.
    onoff    Flag specifying whether we want to add or remove the light source:
             true to add it to its containing NPC, false to remove it.

UI_earthquake(int length)

    Causes the screen to shake. Also plays the earthquake SFX at the start of
    the effect.

  Parameters:
    length    The earthquake's duration, in ticks.

UI_armageddon()

    Ends the world and kills everyone in it. This is the Armageddon spell from
    BG; use with care :-). This intrinsic also exists in the original SI, though
    unlike what happens in BG, it seems to leave no survivors.

    Who survives armageddon seems to be hard-coded in the original games; in
    Exult, you can control who survives this intrinsic by setting the 'Survives
    Armageddon' flag in the 'NPC Flags' tab in Exult Studio.

    Those 'killed' by this intrinsic cannot be resurrected, and they do not
    leave lootable corpses.

    Monster eggs are disabled, as are intrinsics that call guards to attack a
    thieving avatar.

UI_restart_game()

    Stops the music and restarts the game from the last save. The original games
    started from the beginning of the game; Exult does it differently to
    preserve the last quicksave.

UI_run_endgame(bool flag)

    Runs the endgame.

  Parameters:
    flag    Boolean value specifying the manner in which the game was finished.
            If it is true, will set the game-completion flag that allows the
            endgame to be viewed from the title screen.

    ****** BG SPECIFIC ******
    If 'flag' is 'false', the avatar stepped through the Black Gate; if 'true',
    the avatar destroyed the Black Gate.
    **** END BG SPECIFIC ****

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    'flag' has no effect in the endgame.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

UI_error_message([special])

    Prints the input variables to 'stdout'.

  Parameters:
    One to twelve parameters of any type, whether or not they are arrays. Please
    note that the original games only one parameter was accepted.

string UI_printf(string out[])                                           [Exult]

    Prints formatted text to 'stdout'.

  Parameters:
    out    An array of strings. The first element is the 'format' string. The
           format string gives the basic text, and has a placeholder for each of
           the other elements of the array; each element past the first writes
           its text at the next available placeholder. Placeholders are the '%s'
           sequence, without the single quotes, embedded in the format string.

  Return:
    An empty string.

================================================================================
DISPLAY INTRINSICS
================================================================================

    All intrinsics in this section are related to showing things to the player,
    be they other portions of the game map or objects from 'SPRITES.VGA'.

UI_center_view(object obj)                                               [Exult]
obj->center_view()

    Centers the screen on a given object.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object that the screen should be centered on.

UI_display_area(int pos[])

    Displays the specified location on-screen. Overlays sprite shape 10 over the
    screen.

  Parameters:
    pos    The location about which the screen is to be centered. Can be a
           3-element (x, y, z) location or a 4-element (x, y, z, map) location.
           If map is omitted or is -1, the current map is used.

UI_set_camera(object obj)
obj->set_camera()

    Centers the screen on a given object.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object that the screen should be centered on. If it is an NPC,
           the camera will follow that NPC.

UI_view_tile(int[2] pos)

    Centers screen around a given tile. It is usually better to use
    UI_display_area instead.

  Parameters:
    pos    The (x, y) location to be displayed.

UI_wizard_eye(int length)

    Lets the player move the screen around, keeping the avatar in its present
    location. Overlays sprite shape 10 over the screen.

  Parameters:
    length    The duration of the effect, in ticks. Actual duration is increased
              by 50% in Exult.

UI_fade_palette(int length, int unk, bool type)

    Causes the screen to fade to/from black.

  Parameters:
    length    The length, in ticks, of the fade; that is, how long it will take
              for the fade to happen.
    unk       Reserved; must be zero. This is an unknown parameter from the
              original games; it is unimplemented in Exult. It cannot be left
              out, however.
    type      The type of fade. If true, fades from black; if false, fades to
              black.

UI_set_time_palette()

    Resets palette to default palette, based on time of day and number of
    lights.

UI_item_say(object obj, string bark)
obj->item_say(string bark)

    Causes text to be displayed near the object.

  Parameters:
    obj     The object which is to display the text.
    bark    Text to be displayed.

UI_clear_item_say(object obj)                                        [SI, Exult]
obj->clear_item_say()

    Deletes the string (if any) being displayed near the desired object.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object in question.

UI_display_runes(int gump, string runes)

    Displays the selected gump on screen and prints lines of runic text
    on-screen. What font is used to draw the text depends on the gump shown, and
    is currently hard-coded (as of 2009/02/26).

  Parameters:
    gump     The shape in 'GUMPS.VGA' that will be used.
    runes    An array containing one element per line of runes to display.

    If the avatar's READ flag is set, some symbols are converted into pairs of
    letters. Specifically:

    (    TH
    )    EE
    *    NG
    +    EA
    ,    ST
    (    TH

    Additionally, all lowercase letters will be turned into uppercase letters,
    and pipes ('|') will be converted to spaces.

UI_book_mode(object obj)
obj->book_mode()

    Displays a book or scroll on screen. Text in the book or scroll is supplied
    through normal conversation methods.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose shape is to be used to determine what shape from
           'GUMPS.VGA' is to be shown. This association is currently hard-coded
           (as of 2009/02/27): if the shape of the supplied object is equal to
           797, a scroll gump will be displayed; otherwise, a book gump will be
           displayed.

    ****** SI SPECIFIC ******
    There is one additional shape which displays a scroll gump: shape 707. This
    shape, and shape 705 (serpentine book), will both display text using
    serpentine characters; if the avatar's 'READ' flag is set, any serpentine
    runes will be translated into normal runes.
    **** END SI SPECIFIC ****

UI_book_mode_ex(bool is_scroll, int font)                                [Exult]
UI_book_mode_ex(bool is_scroll, int font, int gump)

    Displays a book or scroll on screen. Text in the book or scroll is supplied
    through normal conversation methods.

  Parameters:
    is_scroll    Flag determining whether to display a scroll (true) or a book
                 gump (false). This determines the area occupied by the text,
                 and will determine what shape from 'GUMPS.VGA' to display if
                 none is specified.
    font         Integer that determines what shape from 'FONTS.VGA' will be
                 used to render the text.
    gump         Numerical value determining what shape from 'GUMPS.VGA' will be
                 used. The text area is not affected by this parameter.

    **** IMPORTANT NOTES ****
    Unlike the 'UI_book_mode' intrinsic, this intrinsic performs *no*
    translation of any kind if the avatar's 'READ' flag is set. This is an
    intentional design feature -- for example, text written in Gargish and being
    displayed in a Gargish font should be translated by more than a mere font
    substitution. Also, the gump shapes should be 'compatible' with the standard
    book/scroll shapes as Exult will write the text in the same region of the
    screen as it does for standard books/scrolls.
    ** END IMPORTANT NOTES **

UI_close_gumps()

    Closes all gumps.

UI_close_gump(object obj)
obj->close_gump()

    Closes an object's gump.

  Parameters:
    obj    The object whose gump is to be closed.

bool UI_in_gump_mode()

    Returns 'true' if showing gumps, 'false' otherwise.

UI_display_map()                                                            [BG]

    Displays the main game map. Will also display the sextant crosshairs if the
    party has a sextant.

UI_si_display_map(int num)                                                  [SI]

    Displays the specified map on screen.

  Parameters:
    num    Index of the map to be displayed. This is converted into a shape in
           'SPRITES.VGA' in a hard-coded manner.

UI_display_map_ex(int mapshp, bool show_loc)                             [Exult]

    Displays the given map centered in the screen.

  Parameters:
    mapshp      The shape in 'SPRITES.VGA' to be displayed as a map.
    show_loc    true to show the sextant crosshairs, false otherwise. Showing
                the crosshairs does not depend on being underground or actually
                having sextants.

UI_lightning()

    Causes a lightning effect. The screen flashes, and the corresponding sound
    effect is played.

UI_sprite_effect(int sprite, int x, int y, int vel_x, int vel_y, int frame, int
        reps)

    Displays a graphical effect at the given location.

  Parameters:
    sprite    The shape in 'SPRITES.VGA' to be displayed.
    x         The initial horizontal location at which the sprite will be
              displayed.
    y         The initial vertical location at which the sprite will be
              displayed.
    vel_x     The horizontal speed at which the sprite will move. This is added
              to the location at every tick.
    vel_y     The vertical speed at which the sprite will move. This is added to
              the location at every tick.
    frame     The initial frame in 'SPRITES.VGA' of the sprite. This is
              increased by one every tick, and may loop back to zero when it
              reaches the last frame (depending on the value of the 'reps'
              parameter).
    reps      Number of repetitions to execute. If zero, the sprite will be
              displayed for a tick and then go away. If positive, how many times
              the sprite frame will go through all of its frames. If negative,
              the sprite will go thgouth all of its frames *once*.

UI_obj_sprite_effect(object obj, int sprite, int rel_x, int rel_y, int vel_x,
        int vel_y, int frnum, int reps)
obj->obj_sprite_effect(int sprite, int rel_x, int rel_y, int vel_x, int vel_y,
        int frnum, int reps)

    Creates a sprite effect from 'SPRITES.VGA'. This sprite effect is tied to
    'obj'; if 'obj' moves, the sprite will move along. 'sprite' is the sprite's
    shape number, ('rel_x', 'rel_y') is the relative (x, y) offset of the sprite
    relative to the position of 'obj', ('vel_x', 'vel_y') is the (x, y) speed
    (i.e., change in coordinates at every tick, and in addition to any motion of
    'obj'). 'frnum' is the initial frame of the sprite effect. If 'reps' < 0,
    the sprite effect goes through all frames (at the rate of one frame per
    tick) and deletes itself; otherwise, 'reps' is the total number of ticks the
    animation will last before deleting itself, looping the sprite's frames if
    it is needed.

    Displays a graphical effect around a given object. This sprite effect is
    linked to the object, and will move with it.

  Parameters:
    obj       The object about which the effect will happen.
    sprite    The shape in 'SPRITES.VGA' to be displayed.
    rel_x     The initial horizontal offset from the object at which the sprite
              will be displayed.
    rel_y     The initial vertical offset from the object at which the sprite
              will be displayed.
    vel_x     The horizontal speed at which the sprite will move. This is added
              to the horizontal offset at every tick.
    vel_y     The vertical speed at which the sprite will move. This is added to
              the vertical offset at every tick.
    frame     The initial frame in 'SPRITES.VGA' of the sprite. This is
              increased by one every tick, and may loop back to zero when it
              reaches the last frame (depending on the value of the 'reps'
              parameter).
    reps      Number of repetitions to execute. If zero, the sprite will be
              displayed for a tick and then go away. If positive, how many times
              the sprite frame will go through all of its frames. If negative,
              the sprite will go through all of its frames *once*.

    index    The spell to be added. This index starts at zero, and must be in
             the 0-71 range.
    unk      Reserved, must be zero. This is an unknown parameter from the
             original games; it doesn't seem to have any effects there, and is
             unused in Exult. You must still pass it to calls to this intrinsic,
             though.
    obj      What spellbook the spell should be added to.

  Return:
    false if the supplied object is not a spellbook or if it already has the

obj->mark_virtue_stone()

    Imprints a virtue stone with its current location. Any subsequent calls to
    recall_virtue_stone that target that same stone will teleport the avatar's
    party to this stored location. The stored location includes the map where
    the stone is.

  Parameters:
    obj    The virtue stone to be marked.

UI_recall_virtue_stone(object obj, bool flag)                               [BG]
obj->recall_virtue_stone(bool flag)

    Teleports the party to the virtue stone's stored location. The stone is
    forcibly given to the avatar if needed.

  Parameters:
    obj     The virtue stone that contains the destination.
    flag    This optional parameter controls controls whether or party members
            that are paralyzed or asleep; if true, these members will be
            teleported, otherwise, they won't defaults to false.

    it will delete the nearby planets, if any, and create new ones in the
    required positions.

bool UI_is_water(int pos[3])

    Determines if a given tile or object is a water tile.

  Parameters:
    pos    Location of tile or object to be tested.

  Return:
    true if the specified tile or object is a water tile, false otherwise.

string UI_a_or_an(string text)

    Checks whether a bit of text starts with a vowel or not.

  Parameters:
    text    The string being inspected.

  Return:
    If the first letter of the supplied string is in the "aeiouyAEIOUY" set,
    returns 'an'; otherwise, returns 'a'.

bool UI_is_dest_reachable(actor npc, int pos[])                          [Exult]
bool npc->is_dest_reachable(int pos[])

    Checks if a NPC can walk from its present location to a specified position.

  Parameters:
    npc    The NPC we wish to check.
    pos    Where we want check if the NPC can go.

  Return:
    true if the NPC can walk to the supplied destination, false otherwise.

bool UI_can_avatar_reach_pos(int pos[])                                     [SI]

    Checks if the avatar can walk from its present location to a specified
    position. This is similar to, but more limited than, the is_dest_reachable
    Exult intrinsic.

  Parameters:
    pos    Where we want check if the avatar can go. Must have at least two
           elements; if it has exactly two elements, Exult will assume the z
           coordinate of the destination to be zero.

  Return:
    false if the supplied position is invalid or if the avatar cannot reach the
    supplied destination, true otherwise.

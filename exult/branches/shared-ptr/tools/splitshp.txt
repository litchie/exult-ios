NAME
====

splitshp - Split Shape into frames or combine frames into Shapes 
  

SYNOPSIS
========

splitshp SHAPE FRAME... 
splitshp SHAPE 
  

DESCRIPTION
===========

Shape files are used for storage of all visible elements (from UI buttons to 
terrain features) of the games Exult supports. Shapes contain one or more 
frames. splitshp can be used to combine frames into one file, or split a Shape 
file into its component frames. 
The mode of operation is determined by looking at the number of commandline 
arguments. Exactly one argument means splitting, more than one argument signals 
a combining operation. 
  

Combining
=========

Each FRAME names a Shape file typically consisting of only one frame (i.e. 
subsequent frames are ignored). All these frames are concatenated and written to 
the Shape file SHAPE. 
  

Splitting
=========

SHAPE will be read and split into its component frames. Each of those will be 
written to its own Shape file. The names of these files are determined by 
splitting the name of SHAPE before the last dot --- anything before this dot is 
the STEM, anything else (including the dot) is the PREFIX, which may be empty in 
case there is no dot in the name. The output files are then named STEM_nnSUFFIX 
with nn replaced by the frame number. 
  

EXAMPLES
========

  splitshp button.shp button-up.shp button-down.shp 
  Packs the (first) two frames from button-up.shp and button-down.shp into the 
  Shape file button.shp
 
  splitshp grizzly 
  Unpacks the frames contained in the Shape file grizzly into the (single-frame) 
  Shape files grizzly_00, grizzly_01, grizzly_02, etc. 

  splitshp boar.new.shp 
  Unpacks the frames contained in the Shape file boar.new.shp into the 
  (single-frame) Shape files boar.new_00.shp, boar.new_01.shp, boar.new_02.shp, 
  etc.

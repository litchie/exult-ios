Music:
Bear in mind that we have permission to use the MIDIs from 
Age of the Dragon, so if we need additional music... (Nadir)

characters ideas:
-Jeff: a healer (Dr.Code) - to speak to him you have to shout 3xUSECODE
-Colourless: an invisible man
-Willem: a Paladin ("Arthuris")
-Dancer: a dancing monk
-Nadir: As Nadir, I could be an astronomer...
-Kirben: rather be animal
-Exultbot: ExultDOG ?
-Drax: I know, i could be a jester that whenever you talk to babbles on about
 BSD!
-Dominik: another monk/scribe (Dominus)
-some  artists (the artists who did the BG-paperdoll art)

-An evil Bill Gates character
-"invincible" Penguins?

-All  the inhabitants could have some kind of real-life-portraits, like
 Origin  did  in SI.



The "SourceForge of Virtue" addon?

Dominus:
construct some kind of new island in BG (I´d say east or west of
Trinsic) with a whole town dedicated to the contributers of Exult.
Maybe a tame Dragon who is in a flame  war  with  another dragon 
(hommage to the Ultima Dragons).
Some kind of plot and as a reward for the quest there you get the keyring.


Dancer:
I can see it now...a whole new land founded on the three principles: 
speed, thrift, design.

How would these combine into virtues?

S = commitment
T = free software
D = stability
S+T = Component Orientation
S+D = Object Orientation
T+D = Umm.. the Silver Serpent (Python)
S+T+D = ?? I dunno...Motorola, or the internet or somesuch, I guess.

The opposite would be Microsoft, obviously.

another item could be added:
the special item called the "the secret decoder ring", you will only get it if you have Tseramed in your party once you get to sourceforge island.
He will say something like:  "Avatar, I´ve been to this island before and stole that ring from the evil gods"
Properties of that ring: perm read flag and/or  identify things like potions or weapon values

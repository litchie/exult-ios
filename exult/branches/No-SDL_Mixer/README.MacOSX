Exult instructions for Mac OS X
-------------------------------


To play
-------
First you need to get Ultima 7 or Serpent Isle. Either you own
it already, or you buy it somewhere. Then you must install it
on a DOS/Windows machine in order to get the data file.
A good way is to use a PC emulator for this, e.g. Virtual PC,
Real PC or SoftWindows.
Note that the Ultima Collection already contains an installed
copy of Ultima 7 (In the Ultima7/ directory) and of Serpent Isle
(In the Serpent/ directory).
In the documentation of Exult we describe several ways of how
to install the original games.

From the Ultima7 or Serpent folder on your PC, copy the STATIC
sub folder to the 'blackgate' or 'serpentisle' sub folder (as
appropriate) of $HOME/.exult/.

Now run Exult, and have fun!

Possible issue
--------------
Something in our audio code might crash Exult unexpectedly on OSX.
For example the famous scene in SI with Frigidazi has been reported 
as a trigger. To circumvent this disable all audio before a scene 
that crashes and enable it later on in the game.

How to compile on Mac OS X
--------------------------

Make sure you have the Apple developer tools installed. They ship with
Mac OS X, but have to be installed separately. You can also download the
latest version for free from http://developer.apple.com, you must register,
though.

In order to compile Exult, you need to install several Unix packages.
If you are an expert, you may want to install them manually; for all others,
we recommend installing them via Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net) or 
MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).

Install these packages with Fink:
  sdl
  sdl-mixer

Or if you use MacPorts install
  libsdl
  libsdl_mixer
  
If you are compiling the source code SVN, as opposed to the source of
a released version, you also need to install these packages with Fink:
  automake1.9
  libtool14
  
Or these with MacPorts:
  automake
  libtool
  
(for the experts: old versions of the automake package should also work,
e.g. you could also use automake1.8 or automake1.7).

Now you are ready to compile Exult. If you are compiling from SVN, the
first thing you have to run is this:
  ./autogen.sh

The next step is the same whether you compile a release version or SVN:
  ./configure
  make

This will give you a "exult" binary in the current directory. If you want
a nice Exult.app (double clickable from the Finder and all), enter this
command:
  make bundle

Be warned, the binary created this way is not static linked, that means if
you copy it to another machine it will most likely NOT work. So you can only
use it on your own computer.


If you want to compile Exult Studio, you have to install this package:
  libglade2

This might actually cause many other packages required by libglade2 to
be installed. 

After that, you have to re-run configure and make:
  ./configure --enable-exult-studio --enable-macosx-studio-support
  make

In order to use Exult Studio with Exult you will need to do:

- The nice Exult.app will not work with Exult Studio, you will need to run the exult
binary, found where you compiled the source. 

- You need to add the path of Exult Studio to your PATH settings so that Exult can
start Exult Studio on entering Map-Edit-Mode (ctrl+cmd+m).
Normally Exult Studio gets compiled in /path_to_the_Exult_source_code/mapedit, 
so if you do "export PATH=$PATH:/path_to_the_Exult_source_code/mapedit" before 
starting Exult, you can start using Exult and Exult Studio.
If you don't want to set the path to Exult Studio, you can also start Exult,
go into Map-Edit-Mode, start Exult Studio manually and click in it's menu
on File->Connect.

- You need to copy the file exult_studio.glade (found in 
/path_to_the_Exult_source_code/mapedit/) to your Exult data folder which is defined 
in ~/Library/Preferences/exult.cfg.

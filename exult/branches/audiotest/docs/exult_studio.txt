This is the first draft of the Exult Studio documentation. So please bear with me. It is by no means perfect and I ask you to send me all your comments on how to better express some stuff or to point out what I just plain forgot. Dominus



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction
1.1. What is Exult Studio?
Exult is not only capable of playing Ultima 7 but it is also intended as an engine in the style of the one used by Ultima 7. Exult Studio started it's life as a simple map editor but it is slowly developing into a full fledged editor enabling users to create a new game. Tristan came up with the cool name!
Currently there are many steps required to create a new game but at the moment the main goal of Jeff is to make it as user-friendly as possible.
Editing a copyrighted game may or may not be allowed. Please exercise caution especially if you want to distribute your changes.


1.2. About this Documentation.
Exult Studio is work in progress. How things work may change and new features are added very frequently. Due to the lazy nature of the maintainer (Dominus) of this documentation it might not always be up to date. As we do not have an official release yet this documentation refers to recent snapshots.
Note that you also need an up to date (aka recent snapshot) version of Exult to have Exult Studio working properly.


1.3. Terms we use in regard to Exult and Ultima 7
Along with the terms explained in ReadMe.txt there are some more terms that need to be explained for the usage of Exult Studio
* tile: 8x8 pixels
* chunk: 16x16 tiles
* superchunk: 16x16 chunks
* world: 12x12 superchunks




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Configurations
2.1. Installation
* You need Exult and you need to install it properly (see ReadMe.txt)
* For U*ix platforms you need to build Exult Studio from the source avillable from our source snapshot at http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php. You will also need the GTK+ library installed as well as libglade.
* For Win32 platforms (Win9x,ME,2k,XP) you need to download http://exult.sourceforge.net/snapshots/ExultStudio.exe and install it in the same directory where you installed Exult.



2.2. Running Exult Studio
You can run Exult Studio all by itself, but it isn't useful that way, as it uses Exult as a server. What you really want to do is:
* Put 'exult_studio.glade' in the Exult 'data' directory.
* Be sure 'exult_studio' is in your path. (on Win32 'exult_studio.exe' needs to be in the same directory as exult.exe)
* On U*ix platforms you need to be running Exult on X.
* Run Exult in windowed mode (not fullscreen).
* Press 'alt-ctrl-m' to go into 'map-editor' mode. If all is set up correctly, exult_studio will start up, and will have a list of files on the left side of its window (you need to have cheats enabled in Exult, see the ReadMe.txt).

Starting up one or the other separately will reconnect them:
* If Exult isn't running, start it up. Then, in Exult Studio, use the 'File' menu to choose the static directory (for the game you're playing).
* If Exult Studio isn't running start it up with: exult_studio -x (path to dir containing exult_studio.glade) -d (path to game directory)

You can also reconnect by selecting File-Connect in Exult Studio's menus.


2.3. Settings in exult.cfg.
You can change the settings of Exult Studio either with the prefernces dialog or via exult.cfg. Those settings are:
<config>
<estudio>
<main>
<width>
640
						** width of the program window 
						
</width>
<height>
400
						** height of the program window
						
</height>
</main>
<default_game>
gamename
						** default game to edit (games must be specified in 
						<game> part of exult.cfg)
						
</default_game>
<image_editor>
gimp-remote -n
						** command that calls the image editor. Only useful on U*ix 
						platforms for now.
						
</image_editor>
<background_color>
0
						** background color for the shape-chooser. Use the preference 
						dialog of Exult Studio for this.
						
</background_color>
</estudio>
</config>


2.4. Command line options
Exult Studio offers some "hidden" command line options:
* -gGAMENAME specifies GAMENAME and Exult Studio will read the game base directory from exult.cfg. GAMENAME can be choosen from the games specified in <game> part of exult.cfg.
* -xDIRECTORY tells exult_studio to look in DIRECTORY for its user-interface specification (exult_studio.glade). This option is only useful to developers who want to edit exult_studio.glade themselves.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Menu Options
3.1. File
* New Game... This lets you begin the work on a new game. Jeff wrote an extensive description of how to use this and how it works. See New Game manual.
* Open Game... Choose the Game directory of the game you want to edit.
* Save all 'Ctrl+S' Saves map, shape infos and groups you edited (see below).
* New... Shapes file... Lets you choose the directory where you want to create a new vga file and requires you to enter a name for it (e.g. mygame.vga). Single shape file... Lets you choose the directory where you want to create a new shape file and requires you to enter a name for it (e.g. mygame.shp).
* Save... Map Saves the map of the edited game. Shape info When you right click a shape in a vga file you can change the info of the shape. This saves this changed info. Groups You can "bundle" shapes of vga files into groups to make world building easier. These groups get saved with this option.
* Reload... Map 'Ctrl+R' Reloads the map. All changes made since the last save get discarded. Usecode Very useful when you edit the usecode of a game or add new usecode to an existing game. Normally this would require a restart of Exult.
* Connect Connects Exult and Exult Studio if one of them had to be restarted.
* Preferences Image Editor Command: This executes the chosen image editor when you want to edit a shape when you right click it. Image-Edit Filetype: Choose which filetype gets executed with the above cosen image editor. Default Game Name: Choose the game Exult Studio opens by default. Use the name specified in exult.cfg. Shape List Background: Sometimes the default black background may make certain shapes hard to see. Choose a different background colour here.
* Exit 'Ctrl+Q' Exits Exult Studio.

Note that the default location for saving and creation of new files is the STATIC directory of a game if there is no PATCH directory specified. See 5.1. What you can do at the moment.


3.2. Objects
* Egg... Create or edit eggs with this. See 5.3. Creating/editing Eggs for more information (not yet there).
* NPC... Create or edit NPCs with this. See 5.4. Creating/editing NPCs for more information (not yet there).



3.3. Mode
It describes how the mouse behaves inside Exult when map-editing.
* Move This is the normal mode where you can drag things with the mouse, or single-click to identify objects.
* Paint a single-left-click inserts the last-selected shape from 'shapes.vga', and dragging with the left-button inserts that shape in every tile (so you'd probably only want to do this with 8x8 flat shapes). Also, in 'Paint' mode, the footprint at ground level is shown (though this may be changed in the future). If you hold the alt key down, random frames from the currently-selected shape will be painted (handy for grassy areas).
* Pick for Combo Picks objects for a new combo file. Double-left-click to add objects to the combo, single-left-click to identify object. See 5.5. Creating Combination files
* Select In this mode you can select objects and move the selection Ctrl-arrow (x,y coordinates) and ctrl-page keys (z coordinates).
* Hide not yet implemented (?)
* Unhide not yet implemented (?)

Note that you can only drag objects in the game window when you are in "Move" mode.


3.4. Tools
* Locator... 'Ctrl+L' shows where the current game window is within the entire map, and lets you move the view by double-clicking a location or by dragging the little box
* New Combo Creates a new Combo file. See 5.5. Creating Combination files.



3.5. Tool bar
* Play This is the same as pressing 'Alt+Ctrl+M' in Exult. It exits the Map Edit Mode and lets you play the game. By pressing it again you enter Map Edit Mode again.
* Tile Grid Shows a grid in the game window for better control on placing objects.
* Edit lift: Changes the lift of a selected object in the game window. Lift means the distance of an object from the ground.
* Hide lift: Hides objects that are above the choosen height.
* Edit terrain See 5.1. What you can do at the moment. Note that a terrain is used in multiple instances of the map and changing it in one place changes it in all the others as well.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Main Working Window
4.1. Description
Once Exult Studio runs correctly , a tree of game files is displayed to the left of the main window, while the currently selected file is viewed in detail to the right. At the moment, the following types of files are supported.


4.2. Shape files
Shapes are the basic graphical elements of the game. Each shape has one or more frames that typically represent different states or angles of the same thing. E.g. a button shape could have frames for pressed, and released; a character could have frames depicting her sitting, standing up facing one way, or another, swinging a punch, etc. When a shape file is selected, the right part of the main window will show frame zero of the shapes contained therein. Shapes can be selected by clicking, which will show there number, number of frames, and name if known. Other frames can be viewed by changing the frame number.
When the selected file contains shapes that have names in their info you can also use the find option to find shapes that have that name (e.g. in shapes.vga you can search for 'door' to find all shapes that have door frames). You can search down or up in the selected file.
Shape files also have a special right-click-menu. See 5.2. The shape editor.


4.3. Map files
These files contain so called chunks that serve as templates in the final map. The chunks of the selected map file are shown in the right part of the main window. When a chunk is selected you have some options:
* Locate shows places in the Exult game where that chunk is used.
* Insert New Creates a new chunk. Drag the new chunk onto the game and edit it by dragging shapes on it. Dupe Duplicates a chunk. Drag the duplicate chunk onto the map to edit it.
* Move Moves a chunk in the chunk file. This does not effect the display on the map.



4.4. Palettes files
The palettes used by a game are stored in the files listed there. When you select a palette with number zero is shown in the right part of the main window. Other palettes are shown by selecting another palettes number When a palettes file is selected you have some options:
* Edit New/Remove adds or deletes a palettes.
* Move Moves palettes in the file.
* File Import Overwrites the current palettes with palette text file. Export Exports the current palette to a text file.



4.5. Groups files
Editing a game can become quite cumbersome when you have to choose between a lot of shape files containing several frames. To make this task easier we have implemented so called groups to groups several shapes together. For example you can group all shapes containing door frames together in a group called 'doors'. For this you have to select Groups and create a new group by writing the name in the lower part of the window and then click 'add'. You now have the option in the Shape Menu to add a shape to this group. When you doubleclick a group the group window opens that shows the shapes in the group and by selecting a shape you see the shape info. You also have some options to edit the group:
* Move Moves the shapes within the group.
* Remove Removes the shape from the group.
* Name Changes the name of the group.
* Frame: select the frame displayed.
* Frames shows all the frames of a shape next to each others.
* Find Lets you search for a specified shape in the group.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Editing a Game
5.1. What you can do at the moment
With the latest source you can
* browse shapes in the main window.
* drag a shape from the shape browser to Exult, and that object will be placed in the game.
* edit an 'egg' by double-clicking on it. An edit box should appear.
* create a new 'egg' using the pull-down menu in Exult Studio. In the Egg edit box, after you hit 'Apply', you'll be prompted to click in Exult where you want the egg to appear.
* If editing a 'monster' egg, you can set the monster by dragging the shape from the browser to the area that displays the monster.
* edit an NPC by double-clicking on it, and also create a new NPC using the pull-down menu. Attributes, flags, and schedules can all be viewed and modified.
* can edit other objects' position and quality by double-clicking on them.
* browse the 'u7chunks' file, and drag them into Exult to change the terrain. In this browser, you can also create new terrains and modify their order.
* edit a 'terrain' (stored in 'u7chunks') by clicking the "Edit terrain" checkbox in Exult Studio. This is a special mode where dragging with the left mouse button 'paints' the currently-selected shape (generally one of the flat tiles near the top of the shapes browser). Note that a 'terrain' is generally used in multiple places in the mapand changing it in one place changes it in all the others as well.
* save the map using ExultStudio's "File-Save map" pulldown. In order to avoid writing over files inadvertantly, the files that would normally go into the 'static' directory, will, instead, go into a 'patch' directory that you specify in your 'exult.cfg' file. Here's an example for editing BG:

<game>
<blackgate>
<path>
blackgate
</path>
<patch>
blackgate/patch
</patch>
<title>
blackgate
</title>
.
</blackgate>
Exult will also read files from 'patch' if it exists on starting a new game.
In any mode, you can add the currently selected shape by shift-clicking..


5.2. The shape editor
When you right click on a shape in the Shape browser (e.g. Files-Shapes.vga) you get some options of how to edit the shapes.
* Info... Displays the information of an object. You can change a lot of stuff there and caution is adviced. The information is saved by 3.1. File.
* Add to group... If you set up groups you can add shapes to them with this.
* Edit...: Brings up your image-editor on the chosen frame. When you save in the image-editor, ES will read the changes back within 5 seconds. This is especially convenient if you have 'gimp-remote', as it will open a window for the frame in an already-running gimp.
* Edit tiled: This is only for 'flat' (8x8) shapes. It forms an image from all the frames and brings it up in the image-editor. This is really handy for making lots of terrain frames like grass. A dialog lets you choose the dimensions.
* New frame: Creates a new frame after the currently-selected one. The 'insert' key also does this (and the 'del' key deletes a frame, though it's buggy if there's just one frame left).
* New shape: Gives you a dialog for choosing the shape #, as well as the initial # of frames. You can also create a new font shape from TrueType or Type1 font files. It's mainly a convenience for someone creating a whole new game, as their only single-colored. Maybe in the future we'll have some functions to create two-colored fonts like the main one in U7, although it might take hand-editing to make the letters look that nice.
* Import/Export frame: Let's you import a single frame from a .png file or export to a .png.

Note:Edit... doesn't work on Windows system. It stores the shape as PNG file in GAMEDIR/itmp/ (e.g. blackgate/itmp). If you manually open the file with an image editor of your liking and then save it, ES doesn't read the changes back.


5.3. Creating/editing Eggs
sorry, not documented yet (very extensive work). But make sure you resize the egg-window to show all the possible eggs. To know what 'egg' means, see ReadMe.txt.


5.4. Creating/editing NPCs
sorry, not documented yet (very extensive work).


5.5. Creating Combination files
Create 'combination shapes', like a fence or an entire roof by selecting "Tools-New Combo" (see 3.4.). When you run Exult Studio the first time a file called combos.flx gets automatically created in the "Patch" directory. Choose the 'Pick for Combo' choice in the 'Modes' menu, and an empty window should pop up. In the game window, double-click a group of objects, and they should appear in the window. You can then select an object there and tweak its position. When you are done hit aply and the combo gets temporally saved until you hit "Save all" or "Save - Save map". You can drag and drop combinations into the game window.


5.6. Custom Usecode
As hinted at (see ReadMe.txt) Usecode is actually what runs Ultima 7 and therefore any game created with Exult Studio. As of yet we do not have a Usecode editor/debugger. So writing your own Usecode is not that easy.
For an example of how Usecode may look like download our experimental patch for BG at http://exult.sourceforge.net/snapshots/patch.zip. In that zip you'll find a readme.txt which tells you how to run it. You will also see two files called usecode.uc and usecode.
Usecode.uc is the usecode script that will help you understand our usecode language. When you run ucc (see 6.1.) with that file (e.g. "ucc -o usecode usecode.uc") you will get the file called usecode. This file 'usecode' should be the same as the one in the zip file.
Someone does have to write extensive documentation for this but I (Dominus) am not really up for that task. Pertex has written some documentation at http://www.sophen.de/exult/ that might be able help you.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Miscellaneous
6.1. Other tools that might be useful
In the process of creating Exult the team came up with some useful tools that might help in editing/making a game. These can be built from the Exult source or you can download the Windows binary snapshot. The source and binary snapshot can be found at http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php. The tools are:
* expack: lets you extract and create Flex files. See manual.
* ipack: a tool for creating and updating Exult and U7 image archives, such as 'shapes.vga'. See manual.
* shp2pcx: converts all frames contained in a Shape file into PCX-format image files. See manual.
* splitshp: can be used to combine frames of a Shape file into one file, or split a Shape file into its component frames. See manual.
* textpack: can be used edit text flex files. See manual.
* ucc: can be used to create custom usecode (see 5.6.).
* The GIMP Plug-in: can be used for editing shapes in the GIMP. Handles multiframe Shape files. See http://www.gimp.org for inormation on the GIMP.
* Photoshop Plug-in: can be used for editing shapes in Photoshop. Can't handle multiframe Shape files. And also can't handle indexed images with Alpha correctly.



6.2. Porting Exult Studio to other platforms
Currently Exult Studio runs on U*ix and Windows platforms. First it only ran on U*ix but with some effort by Colourless, Kirben and Mark Siewert it was succesfully ported to Win32.
A port to other platforms depends on when someone volunteers to do the work :-) There are three issues:
* GTK has to be ported to the platform.
* Exult Studio uses sockets to communicate with Exult.
* X drag-n-drop is used to put new objects on the landscape. The 'drop' part of this had to be rewritten for Win32 Exult, OR, drag-n-drop could be an enhancement to SDL someday. As an alternative to dragging objects, you can now select a shape, then insert it into the game window by left-clicking while holding the Shift key down.



6.3. About this client/server stuff?
A map-editor needs to provide the ability to display the game, place objects on the map, and move objects around. That functionality is already in Exult, and it makes sense to reuse it. So we could have made Exult a part of Exult Studio. However, Exult is already a huge program, and is getting unwieldy to work on.
With this architecture, Exult Studio can have all the messy code for displaying/editing dialog boxes, while Exult only needs a little bit of work to handle requests.
Also, I (Jeff) wanted to get a little experience programming with sockets:-)


6.4. About this 'terrain-editing' stuff and why you can't just drag objects to where you want.
This confused me too, and I originally planned on doing away with it. But do a little arithmetic: U7's world has 3072x3072 tiles; that's over 9 million that need to be set. My guess is that they came up with the idea behind 'u7chunks' to save artists time and to give the map a consistent look.
The basic idea is that each 'chunk' of flat terrain, 16x16 tiles, is stored in 'u7chunks', and is indexed by its position in this file (0, 1, 2, ...). The 'u7map' file specifies, for each 'chunk' in the U7 map, which of the terrains is to be used. Since the entire map has 192x192 chunks, or a total of 36,864, and since 'u7chunks' has 3072 entries, each terrain is shared an average of over 10 times. When you go into map-editing mode in Exult, the numbers displayed are the indices from 'u7chunks'.
So here are the three sorts of scenery that you can see and edit:
1. The 'terrain' (flat landscape, rocks, shrubs, and first-story buildings) specified in 'u7chunks' and 'u7map'.
2. Other non-moveable objects (second-floor structures, trees) specified in the 'ifixnn' files.
3. Moveable and changeable objects specified in the 'iregnn' files.

The challenge of writing a map-editor is keeping the above straight, and reading/storing from/to the correct files. It's sorta-kinda working now :-)
For a more detailed explanation, see Gary Thompson's paper, 'u7edit.txt' in our 'docs' directory.


6.5. What's next?
The next things to be implemented are:
* Exult Studioneeds to be able to automatically create palettes 1-n from palette 0 using the code from ipack.
* It will also be very nice to have a Usecode debugger someday as well (Willem is actually working on it).
* A 'flags' editor for viewing and editing the global Usecode flags by name.
* A 'barge' editor for creating things like ships and carts.

7. Credits
7.1. Thanks
* Colourless, Kirben and Mark Siewart invested a lot of effort to port Exult Studio to Win32.

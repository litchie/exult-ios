Here we have the basic audio engine.

What we have so far is an effective audio mixer, and VOC decoder.
Note that VOC decoding is partially customised to Exult, and
the U7 data files. Samples are doubled and expanded to two channels,
and some bytes are cut off each end to eliminate harsh clicking
sounds.

The midi section is going to grow the most. Currently we support
AWE-based cards. Or, to be more precise, we support any card
that already produces listenable MIDI music through kmidi or
'playmidi -e'.

The next stage is either:

a) Load the instrument patches onto AWE cards. I've been given
   some information on that, which I will attribute as soon as
   I've dug up the fellow's name :)
b) Attempt the synthesis myself, probably by carving up timidity
   or some similar tool and hacking on it until I've bent it to
   my evil will.

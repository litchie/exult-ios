Music:
Bear in mind that we have permission to use the MIDIs from 
Age of the Dragon, so if we need additional music... (Nadir)

characters ideas:
-Jeff: a healer (Dr.Code) - to speak to him you have to shout 3xUSECODE
-Colourless: an invisible man
-Willem: a Paladin ("Arthuris")
-Dancer: a dancing monk
-Nadir: As Nadir, I could be an astronomer...
-Kirben: rather be animal
-Exultbot: ExultDOG ?
-Drax: I know, i could be a jester that whenever you talk to babbles on about
 BSD!
-Dominik: another monk/scribe (Dominus)
-some  artists (the artists who did the BG-paperdoll art)

-An evil Bill Gates character
-"invincible" Penguins?

-All  the inhabitants could have some kind of real-life-portraits, like
 Origin  did  in SI.



The "SourceForge of Virtue" addon?

Dominus:
construct some kind of new island in BG (I´d say east or west of
Trinsic) with a whole town dedicated to the contributers of Exult.
Maybe a tame Dragon who is in a flame  war  with  another dragon 
(hommage to the Ultima Dragons).
Some kind of plot and as a reward for the quest there you get the keyring.


Dancer:
I can see it now...a whole new land founded on the three principles: 
speed, thrift, design.

How would these combine into virtues?

S = commitment
T = free software
D = stability
S+T = Component Orientation
S+D = Object Orientation
T+D = Umm.. the Silver Serpent (Python)
S+T+D = ?? I dunno...Motorola, or the internet or somesuch, I guess.

The opposite would be Microsoft, obviously.

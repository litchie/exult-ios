1. Introduction
1.1 What is Exult?
Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 1990's, still has a huge following. But, being a DOS game with a very non-standard memory manager, it is difficult to run it on the latest computers. Exult is a project to create an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems, capable of using the data and graphics files that come with the game.
Exult is being developed in C++ under Linux, MacOS and Windows using the SDL library to make porting to other platforms relatively easy. The current version supports much of the game's plot, allowing you to talk to NPCs, use items, solve quests, and even fight monsters. Music, speech, and the full introduction are also implemented. This, and further development, is only possible due to the work done by other fans who have decoded the various Ultima 7 data files, especially Gary Thompson, Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag.
Exult aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993) play the game on modern hardware, in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing) its original splendor as is possible. You need to own "Ultima 7: The Black Gate" in order to use Exult, and we encourage you to buy a legal copy.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Configurations
2.1 Installation
* First you need to get Ultima 7. Either you own it already, or you buy it somewhere. Then you must install it on a DOS/Windows machine to get the data files. Alternatively you can use a PC emulator to install it. The Ultima Collection already contains a pre-installed version of U7 (in the directory /ultima7 on the CD).
* From the Ultima7 folder on your PC, copy the STATIC sub folder to an appropiate folder - see 1.3. what those could be.
* Now run exult (exult.exe in Windows) and quit it immediately.
* Edit the configuration file with the correct paths for the game folders and sfx files - see 1.2.
* Run exult and enjoy the game :-)

Word of advice: Don't mix the files from BG and SI.
Important: Do not run Exult on an origina Ultima7 game which you're actually in the middle of playing, as Exult's saved files have a different format. There is no way to convert those original savegames and they will just crash Exult.


2.2 Settings in exult.cfg
Exult keeps a configuration file. You can specify where your Ultima 7 installation is, whether you want full-screen graphics, or windowed, and midi devices and midi settings. Some of these options can be set from the Setup menu when you run Exult or via the Game menu.
If you do not already have a configuration file, Exult will make one for you filling in sensible defaults by itself. The location of this file varies slightly. On unix systems you can expect to find it in $HOME/.exult.cfg while other operating systems will probably locate it as 'exult.cfg' in the same directory as the Exult binary. However it is recommended that you edit this file by hand to achieve optimal results for your system.
The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should be simple to understand and modify. Take care though. Handling of syntax errors in this file is not well tested.
Okay, the default file looks like this (do not copy the **and following - these are my remarks).

2.3 Path-Settings
You have two choices on how to setup Exult.
The first one is very easy, just extract all the files from the compiled snapshot archive to the directory where you have The Black Gate or Serpent Isle installed. Concerning the paths you don't have to configure anything.
The other is a little more complicated but appeals to control freaks like me: Make a directory c:\ultima7 make two subfolders named "blackgate" and "serpentisle" (without the quotes of course) Extract or install the two Ultima 7 games into the appropiate folder ("The Black Gate" to c:\ultima7\blackgate and "Serpent Isle" to c:\ultima7\serpentisle) Extract the compiled Exult to c:\ultima7 Now you have to edit the exult.cfg file like this:
<disk>
<data_path>
data
</data_path>
<game>
<blackgate>
<path>
./blackgate
</path>
<title>
blackgate
</title>
</blackgate>
<serpentisle>
<path>
./serpentisle
</path>
</serpentisle>
</game>
</disk>
You can either use the relative (./blackgate) or absolute (c:\ultima\blackgate) path to point to the correct directory.

3. Audio
3.1 Music
Midi in Exult is played by firstly loading a file and passing it to the XMIDI class for instrument mapping conversion. This is so the MT32 mapped music files from the original Ultima 7 and Serpent Isle will be playable on modern General Midi and General Midi/GS supporting sound cards. You can change the way the music sounds via the setup or ingame menu or the exult.cfg file.
Exult gives users various option for converting Music and Midi Sound Effects. Currently the only way to set the options is via manually editing the config file. Note, the options are case sensitive and all options must be lowercase. Below is a description of all the modes:
* gm This will convert the MT32 patches to standard General Midi patches. Conversion is fairly accurate but some instruments may be different.
* gs This will convert the MT32 patches to their equivilant GS patches. This will be a more accurate conversion that straight gm since more of the MT32 patches are in the GS set. However, not all midi devices will support this mode.
* gs127 This option is for midi devices that have a MT32 patch bank installed in Bank 127. Some GS implimentation have this, some don't. Only use this if you know that you have a MT32 implimentation on Bank 127.
* none This option will output the music with nothing changed. Because the mapping will be for MT32s you should only use this option if you have a MT32 compatible device or you have replaced the music.

The order of music conversion quality is:
1. none (shouldn't really be used, though)
2. gs127
3. gs
4. gm

NOTE: Currently the conversion to GS and GS127 is not finished and the notes are only mapped to General Midi.


3.2 Abilities and limitations of the music engine
Due to the way the class was constructed input can be in either .mid, .rmi or the Miles Sound System .xmi format. There are no limitations to they types of .mid and .rmi supported. They can be Type 0, 1 and the rarely seen type 2. The loading routine is also fairly lineient of errorneous XMIDI files that do not have correct XMIDI headers.
During the development of the XMIDI class it was found that certain .xmi files in Serpent Isle had the first patch changes after the first note. The converter will attempt to correct these errors. However it may cause problems with some midi files. Currently this can not be disabled and may change in the future.


3.3 Digital Wave Sound Effects
You have to set a path to the sfx pack in the waves settings in exult.cfg (see 1.2.). You have to download seperate packs for each game as order of the sfx in BG and SI varies a bit and otherwise will sound odd. However there is a little issue with sfx playback in SI.
Note that configuring your soundfonts is not needed for digital wave sfx.
The sfx pack made by Joseph Morris can be found at http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/exult/jmsfx.zip (~4.55 MB) for "The Black Gate" and http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/exult/jmsfxsi.zip (~6.01 MB) for "Serpent Isle". He recorded the original 114 sfx used in Black Gate which must have been a lot of work. If your soundcard doesn't support soundfonts this pack is a "must-have". Enjoy!


3.4 Speech
Exult can play the Ultima VII's speech through SDL, and its own internal mixer. Configuration is managed through Exult's configuration file.


3.5 Turn off Audio
Press 'Esc' to turn on/off Music, Speech and SoundFX or change the settings in exult.cfg - see 1.2..



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Video
4.1 Resolution
By default Exult runs at 320x200 (which is the resolution the original Ultima VII used). Exult uses different scaling engines to double the size to 640x400 and increase the quality of the graphics.
Using higher resolutions is considered cheating as you can see too much of the surrounding area. But don't let that stop you :-) Being able to play in higher resolutions is one of the big advantages of Exult.
Your screen should be set to 16-bit color mode.
Within the game you can use the 'Alt +' and 'Alt -' to switch resolution..


4.2 Scaler
The scalers also work with higher resolutions than 320x200. To change the scaling method either use the Exult menu or change your exult.cfg - see 1.2..
* SuperEagle by Derek Liauw
* 2xSaI by Derek Liauw
* bilinear
* point duplicates the pixels
* interlaced the same as point except misses every other line

Try them out to see how they look and which you like best.

5. Movement and Keys
5.1. Movement
  * Hold right mouse button down to move Avatar.
  * Double-click with the right mouse button will make the Avatar find a path to the selected spot.
  * Click on objects with left button to identify them.
  * Double-click on characters to hold conversations.
  * Double-click on doors, shutters with left button to open or close them.
 
5.2. Keyboard commands
Starting with V0.91 Alpha2 all key commands can be changed. However, there is a default setting which closely follows the original with the addition of some improvements. 

To change your key bindings first edit the file defaultkeys.txt in your Exult directory, change the bindings and save the file (e.g. as my_keys.txt). Now you have to change exult.cfg to use that file. You can even choose if you want to change your key bindings for BG or SI. See the keys settings at 1.2.. Change (default) to my_keys.txt. 

During the game press 'h' to see a help screen with all the keys (for MacOS change Alt for Cmd - the in-game help screen shows the correct key combination for MacOS).

6. OS specific notes
6.1 OSX
A port to OSX is in the works.


6.2 Audio with MacOS
Exult Mac will have midi, sfx and speech support in the next version.


6.3 Error Log
* MacOS/Win32: Exult generates the files 'stdout.txt' and 'stderr.txt'. These may give you some idea of what is going on under the hood. When Exult suddenly quits, sometimes these files can help.
* Unix/Unix clones: the above mentioned logs are shown in the console from which Exult is started. ./exult > log will send both stderr and stdout to the file named "log".

7. Credits and Contact
7.1 Thanks
* The paper by Gary Thompson on the structure of the U7 data files was crucial to the early development of Exult.
* Work by Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag made the "usecode" interpreter possible.
* Olivier Marcoux's technical document was also crucial in understanding some data files.
* Thanks also go to the person who wrote u7items.txt and the contributor of the "avatar.ttf" font.

Exult instructions for BeOS
----------------------------


To play
-------
First you need to get Ultima 7. Either you own it already, or
you buy it somewhere. Then you must install it on a DOS/Windows
machine to get the data files. 
Alternatively, the 'Ultima Collection' already contains a
pre-installed version of U7. (in the directory /ultima7)

When you run Exult for the first time, it will generate a default
~/.exult.cfg. (Quit from the main menu, since Exult won't be able
to find U7). You need point the paths in this file to the ultima7
directory and the Exult data directory. The relevant entries should
read something like this:

<config>
 <disk>
  <game>
   <blackgate>
    <path>
    /path/to/ultima7/directory
    </path>
    <title>
    blackgate
    </title>
   </blackgate>
  </game>
  <data_path>
  /path/to/exult/data/directory
 </disk>

(rest of the config file)

When the paths are set correctly, you can run Exult in BeOS.
Have fun!

Notes
------
* so far, only BlackGate (BG) plus Forge of Virtue (FoV)
are supported by exult. We are working heavily on getting 
Serpent Isle and The Silver Seed to work as well, though.
Please be patient.

* If you're brave, you can try and twiddle with ~/.exult.cfg.

* You can build exult from source yourself if you want.
To do this, you obviously need the Exult source code. You'll
also need the development SDL binaries or the SDL source.
(available from www.libsdl.org)
To build exult: copy Makefile.be to Makefile, and run 'make'.

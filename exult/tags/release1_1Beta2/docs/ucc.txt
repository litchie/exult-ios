Documentation for UCC, Exult's 'usecode' compiler.
May, 21, 2002 - JSF

0. Introduction
---------------
Ultima7's plot and conversations are controlled by a script encoded in
'usecode', a file in the game's 'static' directory.  UCC is our
attempt at providing a language and compiler so that we and others can
write our own game plots.

This document is my first at documenting UCC.  Please be aware that
the UCC language is still being developed, so some language constructs
may change to make script-writing easier.

The UCC language (which I'll sometimes refer to as 'usecode') is
generally patterned after 'C', but with many exceptions:
	  * No type-checking.  Values can be integers, strings, and
	  vectors.
	  * Some constructs ('for' loops, 'case' statements) are not
	  implemented. (This may change.)
	  * Game-specific features have been added, such as
	  'converse'.
	  * Functions need to be assigned unique numbers (though this
	  may be relaxed in the future).

1. Top-Level
------------
At the top-level, UCC supports pre-processor directives, functions,
function prototypes, and integer constant declarations.

    1.1  Pre-processing
    -------------------
    UCC only supports the "#include <filename>" for pulling in another
    source file.  In the future, support for macros ("#define") may be
    added.  And although we have not done so yet, we should also
    provide header files that declare various Exult constants.

    1.2  Functions
    --------------
    Functions are similar to those in C, but without type
    declarations.  Plus, one must assign a unique number
    which may be used to reference that function in
    ExultStudio.

    Example:	Add2 0x793 (a, b)
		     {
		     return a + b;
		     }

    Ranges of function numbers have specific meanings in Exult:

    0-0x3ff	       Function # is called for a game shape of that
		       number.
    0x400-0x5ff	       Function # 0x400+N applies to NPC #N.
    0x600-0x7ff	       Used for 'Usecode eggs' (trigger points on the
		       game map), except that 0x640-?? are used for
		       spells.
    0x800-	       I think these are for general-purpose use.

    1.3  Function Prototypes
    ------------------------
    These are declarations of other functions that can be called.  In
    particular, these can refer to functions in U7 usecode.  Example:

	extern Ask_yesno 0x90a();  // Rets. true if 'Yes'.

    1.4  Constant Declarations
    --------------------------
    One can declare integer constants globally, as follows:

        const int AMY = 0x168;	   // Amy's NPC #.
	const int AVATAR = -356;

2. Statements
-------------
.... Mainly want to document conversations at the moment:

    2.x  Conversations
    ------------------
    Since conversations are one of the game's strong points, I've tried
    to make their creation as easy as possible.  The structure is:

    converse (<array of choices to enable>)
	     {
    case <answer string> [(remove)]:
	 <Code to execute if answer is chosen>
    ...
	     }

    The above works like a loop, getting a choice from the user at the
    top, and then executing the code under the 'case' for that
    choice.  The process ends when a 'break;' is encountered.

    If "(remove)" appears on the 'case' line, the choice is removed
    from the screen when the user selects it.  Otherwise, it remains.

    One conversation can be nested in another.  When a 'converse' is
    encountered within the code of another 'converse', the inner
    'converse' choices replace the outer 'converse' choices (they're
    pushed onto a stack).  When the inner 'converse' ends, the outer
    'converse' choices are automatically restored.

    While any code can be executed inside a 'case', there are several
    that are especially useful for conversations.  These are:

	 2.x.1:  Say
	 -----------
	 This causes an NPC to 'say' something in the conversation.
	 To specify which NPC (whose face will appear), we provide an
	 interface similar to a method-call in C++.  Example:

	 npc->say("Hello Avatar");

	 'Say' may also be used without specifying an npc.  In this
	 case, the text will appear next to the face of the last npc
	 that spoke.

	 Each 'say()' call will require a click from the user to
	 proceed.  More than one string can be specified in 'say', in
	 which case they are concatenated together.  A '~' in a string
	 will cause text output to pause until the user clicks.
	 Example:

	 npc->say("Hello Avatar,", " it is good to see you.~",
			 "How may I help you?");

        2.x.2:  Add/Remove
	------------------
	These allow you to enable/disable possible choices that the
	user may make.  This only makes sense for choices that appear
	in 'case' entries in the conversation.  Example:

	converse (["Name", "Bye"])	// 2 choices enabled.
		 {
        case "Bye":
	     break;
	case "xyzzy" (remove):
	     say("Please don't make fun of my name.");
	     add("Bye");
	case "Name" (remove):
	     say("My name is xyzzy");
	     add("xyzzy");		// Now this is enabled.
	     remove("Bye");
		 }

        2.x.3:  Hide
	------------
	While "npc->say()" will bring up a portrait of an NPC during a
	conversation, "npc->hide()" will remove that portrait.

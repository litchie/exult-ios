The goal here is to make a unified files API that is inherently
object-centric rather than file-centric. The same (simple) API
is used to fetch any given object by any given exult subsystem
and the subsystem requesting the object does not need to know
what sort of file-format contains the object. The API takes
care of all of that ugly need-to-know business.

For the future, and a game creator, the API can be extended to
pack files as well. I'm also interested in the idea of
configurable redirections, where an object in a collection can
be overriden and replaced by some other file/object and that
redirection be transparent to the core.

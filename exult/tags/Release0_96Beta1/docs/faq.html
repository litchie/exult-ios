				<p>Jeff wrote on the Boards:<br /><cite>
					I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where
					the 'X' comes from. The "ult", of course, comes from Ultima. It
					was only about 6 months ago [02/29/2000] that I replaced the X code with SDL,
					which is multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to
					BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but it was much harder
					to maintain that way.
				</cite></p>
				<p>Ibrahim Holtzmann:<br /><cite>
					I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that
					means "to rejoice, to exhibit great happiness".
				</cite></p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N104">1.2. Is <em>Exult</em> free ?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					<em>Exult</em> is more than free: it's Free (notice the caps). <em>Exult</em> is released
					under the GNU GPL (General Public License). This means that the source code
					for <em>Exult</em> is freely available and you can do whatever you want with it.
					However, if you make modifications to any of <em>Exult</em>'s components and publicly
					redistribute your work you are required to make the source freely available
					in turn. Obviously the <em>Exult</em> team would be very grateful if any
					modifications you make are contributed back to the main code, so that
					everyone can benefit from them. If you want to work on <em>Exult</em> just send an
					e-mail to the 
					<a href="mailto:exult-general@lists.sourceforge.net">team</a>.<br />
 					More information on the GNU GPL at 
 					<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html</a>.

			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N128">1.3. Does Origin support <em>Exult</em>?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					First of all, Origin has been owned by EA for a long time now and from recent 
					developments it seems that Origin only exists now to maintain Ultima Online. 
					Furthermore, Origin and/or people that worked for Origin claim that the source 
					code for Ultima 7 (BG/SI) has been lost for some time.
					So there is no chance for the <em>Exult</em> team to have a look at the actual code.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also the team tried to contact some people from Origin earlier but got no positive
					or negative response on the <em>Exult</em> project. So far it seems that both Origin and 
					EA have decided to ignore <em>Exult</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					On the other hand former Origin employees contacted the team and congratulated the 
					team on their effort. Most noticeable are Lord British himself and Ken Demarest 
					(Programming Manager of Ultima 7)(hint:spell his name backwards).
				</p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N143">1.4. Will <em>Exult</em> support other Ultimas?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					<em>Exult</em> supports only Ultima 7 (BG/SI and the add-ons). It will never support
					any other Ultima nor do members of the team plan to develop something similar.
					The reasons for this are that no other Ultima is similar to Ultima 7 in the 
					internal workings and also the team is quite sick of reverse engineering a game
					already. 
				</p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N154">1.5. Will there be a multiplayer <em>Exult</em>?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					No.
				</p>
				<p>Jeff on the Forum:<br /><cite>
					The question is 'why?'. I continue working on <em>Exult</em>, in large part, because 
					nobody makes games like Ultima7 anymore. While I think a multiplayer game 
					would be technically interesting, I don't see the need. There are <b><i><font size="+1">lots</font></i></b> 
					of them already, and many experienced people working on new ones.
				</cite></p>
				<p>
					Note however that <em>Exult</em> is open source. If you want a multiplayer U7 no one
					holds you back to code it in.

			    <p>
			    	Bugs and not yet implemented features in <em>Exult</em> get fixed almost daily in the code.
			    	A release is very time consuming that's why there are so few.
			    </p>	
			    <p>
					The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It is updated almost
					daily, sometimes twice a day. There is information on how to build your
					own binary in the source but there is also the newest pre-compiled Windows executable.
					If you there is no new one this means that either there were no changes to the code
					or the source failed to compile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also this FAQ mainly addresses the snapshots as people use them and ask question.

					It seems to run most of the available versions of the game. The most common

					runs for sure.
				</p>
				<p>
					However there are reported problems with the localized versions of the
					game (French, German and Spanish). Conversation threads don't seem to skip to the
					next line in the proper places and therefore are unreadable in some cases. SI
					was only published in English so no localization problems with that one.

					Serpent Isle is now playable without cheating and plotholes. Two members of the team

					Old quotes on this topic from the time when SI wasn't playable at all in <em>Exult</em>.
				</p>
				<p>Colourless:<br /><cite>
					I can't say much about the what will happen except that a completely
					working Serpent Isle will be an annoying task to complete. It is
					close to BG in some ways, but very different in others. 
				</cite></p>
				<p>Jeff:<br /><cite>
					My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all
					the work so far on it. I'd much prefer to add enhancements to BG
					(which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG.
					Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals,
					that would change things. And also, since Exult is open-source,
					it would be fine if anyone wants to volunteer to work on SI.

			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N29E">3.3. Why is the party formation different?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>				
				<p>
					In <em>Exult</em> the party (the Avatar and his companions) move quite differently than
					they do in the original. This is actually not a bug but a disliking of the old
					style.
				</p>
				<p>Jeff:<br /><cite>
					It's not a bug, it's a feature! I like it that way.  Everyone is sensitive to 
					different things, and I always though the formation-walking in the original 
					U7 looked really stupid. Eventually, someone may add the original type of walking 
					to Exult, probably as an option.
				</cite></p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N2B1">3.4. 
				What are the improvements in <em>Exult</em> over the original Ultima 7?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<ul>					
				<li>Many more keyboard shortcuts than the original had. Including in BG the 
					
	'<font color="maroon">k</font>'
 key that checks if you have the right key for a lock in your 
					inventory. The list of keys can be found in the Documentation.</li>				
				<li>A new worked over Game menu. This menu is explained in detail in the 
					<a href="docs.php">Documentation</a> and many of the following 
					improvements  and Video/Audio options can be accessed via this menu. Open 
					this Game Menu by pressing 
	'<font color="maroon">Esc</font>'
 in the game.</li>
				<li>SI style paperdoll (inventory screen) in BG. Very impressive. For this you 
					need to have Serpent Isle installed on your hard drive and you must set the 
					path to it in exult.cfg (see the Documentation) and activate it in the 
					Gameplay Options<br />
					This new inventory screen acts sometimes a little buggy, so if an item seems 
					to have disappeared disable the paperdolls in the Game Options.</li>
				<li>A beautiful new savegame box. This allows you much more savegames than 
					the original (you should run out of disc space before you run out of savegame 
					slots), shows a screenshot of the location you saved at, the members of your 
					party, your stats, game time and the date you actually saved. The save game 
					box is opened either via the game menu or the 
	'<font color="maroon">s</font>'
 key.</li>
				<li>Face status bars at the bottom of the screen that show your health (and that 
					of your party members) as well as your mana. Doubleclicking on the face opens 
					the inventory and doubleclicking on the bars shows the status screen.</li>
				<li>Middle mouse button support. In the normal game, the middle mouse button
					activates the target-function (which could also be accomplished by pressing
					't'). for modal gumps, the middle mouse acts as 'return', the right button
					as 'escape', so you can now for example accept the default slider value by
					just pressing the middle button. The escape function is also available
					during most other actions like selecting a target or conversations.</li>
				<li>Wheelmouse support. If you have a wheelmouse some features are auto-enabled 
					in <em>Exult</em>.<br /> 
					In slider gumps (e.g. how much gold you want to 
					drop), scrolling the mouse up/down, moves the slider either left or right. 
					Holding down 
	'<font color="maroon">Alt</font>'

					To get an Ultima 7 that looks and behaves as close to the original as possible there
					are several things to do (though I wonder why you'd want to do that):

				<ul>
				<li>make custom keybindings files (see <a href="docs.php">Documentation</a>) 
					in which you disable all the keys that were not in the original for Black Gate and 
					Serpents Isle.<br /> 
					Since the Alpha 4 release you have to assign 
	'<font color="maroon">s</font>'
 to old_file_gump
					to enable the old savegame menu (the line in your custom keybindings file should look 
					like: S old_file_gump)</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg file to point to those custom keys.</li>
				<li>Disable SI-style paperdolls for BG in exult.cfg (see the documentation for that).</li>
				<li>Alternatively click on the disk icon and disable the paperdolls in the Gameplay 
					Options.</li>
				<li>Edit the exult.cfg to use the resolution of 320x200, to run in full screen and 
					disable scalers.</li>
				<li>The disc icon in the Avatar paperdoll opens the new game menu. As of now this cannot 
					be altered. Sorry!</li>

				<p>
					<em>Exult Studio</em> is a map-editor for <em>Exult</em>, allowing you to modify the map of a

				</p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N373">4.3. What do you need to run it?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					Currently, you need to be running <em>Exult</em> on X (Linux, UNIX, etc.), with
					<em>Exult</em> set to run in a window (not fullscreen).  You also need the GTK+
					library installed.
				</p>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N384">4.4. When will it be ported to other platforms?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					That depends on when someone volunteers to do the work :-) There are
					three issues:
				</p>
				<ul>
   				<li>GTK has to be ported to the platform. I think this is already
					true for Win32.</li>
   				<li><em>Exult Studio</em> uses sockets to communicate with <em>Exult</em>.  This also 
					shouldn't be a problem for Win32.</li>
   				<li>X drag-n-drop is used to put new objects on the landscape.  The
					'drop' part of this will have to be rewritten for Win32 <em>Exult</em>, OR,
					drag-n-drop could be an enhancement to SDL someday.</li>
				</ul>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N3A2">4.5. How do you run it?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					You can run <em>Exult Studio</em> all by itself, but it isn't useful that way,
					as it uses <em>Exult</em> as a server.  What you really want to do is:
				</p>
				<ul>
   				<li>Put 'exult_studio.glade' in the <em>Exult</em> 'data' directory.</li>
   				<li>Be sure 'exult_studio' is in your path.</li>
   				<li>Run <em>Exult</em>.</li>
   				<li>Press 'alt-ctrl-m' to go into 'map-editor' mode.  If all is set
					up correctly, exult_studio will start up, and will have a list of files
					on the left side of its window.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					You can also start up one or the other separately, and they'll
					reconnect:
				</p>
				<ul>
    			<li>If <em>Exult</em> isn't running, start it up.  Then, in <em>Exult Studio</em>,
					use the 'File' menu to choose the static directory (for the game you're
					playing).</li>
   				<li>If <em>Exult Studio</em> isn't running start it up with:
        			exult_studio -x (path to dir containing exult_studio.glade) -d 
        			(path to game directory)</li>
				</ul>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N3D8">4.6. What can you do at the moment?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<ul>
				<li>You can browse shapes in the main window.</li>
   				<li>You can drag a shape from the shape browser to <em>Exult</em>, and that
					object will be placed in the game.  (Note:  Not all such objects 
					are saved with the game yet; saving things like buildings will be 
					implemented soon.)</li>
   				<li>You can edit an 'egg' by double-clicking on it.  An edit box
					should appear.</li>
   				<li>You can create a new 'egg' using the pull-down menu in <em>Exult Studio</em>.  
					In the Egg edit box, after you hit 'Apply', you'll be prompted to
					click in <em>Exult</em> where you want the egg to appear.</li>
   				<li>If editing a 'monster' egg, you can set the monster by dragging
					the shape from the browser to the area that displays the monster.</li>
				</ul>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N3FA">4.7. What's next?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					The next things to be implemented are:
				</p>
				<ul>
    			<li>An NPC editor, similar to the one for Eggs (but with lots more
					stuff to set).</li>
   				<li>A simple object editor, that lets you modify an object's
					'quality', 'quantity' and flags.</li>
   				<li>A 'save-map' function in <em>Exult</em> to save the whole map (not just
					the moveable objects that 'save-game' stores).</li>
				</ul>
			</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong><a name="N415">4.8. What's with this client/server stuff?</a></strong></td></tr><tr><td>
				<p>
					A map-editor needs to provide the ability to display the game, place
					objects on the map, and move objects around.  That functionality is already in
					<em>Exult</em>, and it makes sense to reuse it.  So we could have made <em>Exult</em> a part of
					<em>Exult Studio</em>.  However, <em>Exult</em> is already a huge program, and is getting
					unwieldy to work on.
				</p>
				<p>  
					With this architecture, <em>Exult Studio</em> can have all the messy code for 
					displaying/editing dialog boxes, while <em>Exult</em> only needs a little bit
					of work to handle requests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, I (Jeff) wanted to get a little experience programming with
					sockets:-)

				<ol>
				<li>Read the <a href="http://exult.sourceforge.net/docs.php">Documentation</a>
					and this FAQ to see if that is not already covered and you have all set up correctly.</li>
				<li>Before you report a bug to the 
					<a href="http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2335">bug tracker</a> 
					please try the latest 
					<a href="http://exult.sourceforge.net/download.php">snapshot</a>.
					If the bug still occurs make sure that no one else already reported the bug 
					(in the bug tracker).</li>
				<li>If you are not a Sourceforge member please include your e-mail address this is 
					important so we can get back to you. If you are a Sourceforge member please log in 
					before submitting a bug. If you are a member of Sourceforge you will also get notified
					of follow ups on your bug automatically by E-mail.</li>
				<li>Make sense in the topic! For example, if the problem is with Rowenna in Skara Brae 
					don't just choose "Skara Brae" in the topic. "BG: Rowenna crashes game" makes more 
					sense. Sadly the space for the topics is limited. Explain the topic in "Detailed 
					Description".</li>
				<li>Include information on what version of <em>Exult</em> you are using. You should have used 
					the latest snapshot but please tell us the date of the snapshot.</li>
				<li>State which Operating System you use (Windows 9X, Linux, ...).</li>
				<li>Please include a savegame (use common sense if it is really needed). You will find 
					those in the game directories you put in the exult.cfg. They are called exult**bg.sav 
					(** is a number) for BG and exult**si.sav for SI. You can look up the filename int the
					savegame dialog as well (to the right, above the party members). As some parts of the game 
					may require you to complete other quests or stuff before you get to the bug you want to 
					report it's much easier for the team to look at the problem (speeds the process up a bit 
					as they are much more likely you take a look at the problem this way).</li>
				<li><b><i><font size="+1">One</font></i></b> bug per subject please.</li>			
				</ol>
				<p>
					You can also use our 
					<a href="http://exult.sourceforge.net/forum/">forum</a> 
					to report bugs. But if you do please follow the guidelines mentioned above (you can't
					include a savegame of course). Though be aware that bugs submitted to the bug tracker
					are more likely to get attention than bugs submitted to the forum.
				</p>	
				<p>
					So if you want to have a bug fixed follow these steps!

					<em>Exult</em> often behaves and works differently than the original Ultima 7. These
					behaviors are sometimes features that just differ from the way the original 
					worked.<br /> 
					Some are bugs that the development team consider to have almost no detrimental 
					effect to the enjoyment/running of the game, but would require a large amount 
					of time and effort to fix.<br />
					Please don't bother the team about those as some of these will be fixed in the 
					future, others will only be fixed when someone who thinks it should be done 
					differently sits down and codes it.<br />
					The following are such 'features' of Exult:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Birds and animals open doors and such, like the human and sentient 
						creatures of Britannia do.</li>
					<li>Party members don't walk lockstep with the Avatar like they do in 
						BG/SI. Please see <a href="#N29E">3.3. Why is the party formation different?</a>.</li>
					<li>The way the Avatar and the companions walk. Is it 2 frames or 3 frames?
						This has been changed a lot as this is disputed almost every four weeks.
						Currently <em>Exult</em> is coded using 2 frames.</li>
					<li>Combat works differently. We don't have any hard data or formulae 
						that tell us how combat worked in BG/SI, so DrCode put something 
						together. If you have any information you've worked out related to 
						this, please tell either the forum or the exult-general mailing list.</li>
					<li>Negative health and unconsciousness. Yes, it may look weird to have 
						people walking around with negative health, but that's the way it 
						currently works.</li>

					<li>We don't know what all the data in 'weapons.dat' and 'ammo.dat'
						means, so hit points and damage don't work as well as in the original
						game.</li>
					<li>If you run a resolution higher than the original (320x200) some NPCs
						that are further away from the Avatar may seem to disappear and reappear when
						you get away or closer to them.</li>
					<li>With scalers enabled you might encounter slow downs of the game. The team is
						working on this right now and it is already a lot faster.</li>
					<li>The speech in the intro is out of synch with the lips animation. But now it 
						matches the speed of the text.</li>
					<li>There are reported problems with digital sound effects or speech when 
						using Vortex series sound cards (like the Diamond MX 300) under Win9x/ME. <em>Exult</em>
						is triggering a bug in the drivers. No workaround for now.</li>
					<li>There is also a problem involving Win9x/ME, C-Media soundcard chipsets and MIDI music.

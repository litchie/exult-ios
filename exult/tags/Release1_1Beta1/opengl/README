Don't get too excited; I'm just playing around:-)  Please don't place this
directory in the main build!

Seems like I've seen a lot of game-programmer ads recently, and at least 90% of
them want some sort of 3D experience.  So this is mainly an educational
exercise.

A few goals:

1.  Figure out how to set up a transformation in order to get an orthogonal
view like Ultima7's.  After much unsuccessful fiddling with rotations, I
finally succeeded in doing this by setting up a custom matrix in gltest1.cc.

2.  See how to render U7's 2D bitmaps in an OpenGL world.

3.  Learn how to use textures by creating 3D walls.

4.  Find a free modelling program, and learn how to read in and render
what it produces.

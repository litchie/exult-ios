If you want to do anything with it, you need the usecode file from
Ultima 7: The Black Gate or Ultima7: Serpent Isle. With this file, you can then
create a list by running B.EXE, which shows it on your screen. To redirect it
to a file, use B > FILE, where FILE is the file you want it to.

This file has a lot of functions in it, in the form of:

            Number
Function #0 (0096H), offset = 00000000, size = 00a2, data = 005d

The most interesting part is number. If you run B with that number (B 0096)
you will get the source of that function, as far as is known. Off course, this
can be redirected too.

You can then change that function, and recompile it!

If you want to change a function, you first need to create compiled files and
an index file for all functions. You could do this by hand, but there is a
program for it, called RIP. You can rip a single function (RIP 0096), take all
functions out of the usecode (RIP ALL), only create an index (RIP INDEX), or
put all files and the index back together (RIP GLUE).

The compile is done by the program WUC. You run this by WUC infile outfile.
This means, if you have function 0096 written in file 0096.TXT, you need to run
WUC 0096.TXT 0096, but you could also write FUNCTION.TXT 0096 or something to
that effect.

If you just change a single function, and didn't change the size, you can put
it back with RIP PUT. Otherwise you have to rebuild the entire file with RIP
GLUE, and run MKLINK. When the usecode file is built, copy it over the old
version, and run U7. If you ran MKLINK, also copy the LINKDEP1 and LINKDEP2
files over the old versions. Then it's testing.. Don't forget to make backups!

Read the decompiled usecode to see how to program for U7. If you find out
anything (functions, meanings of opcodes, etc) which is unknown, or have any
comments, please tell Wouter so this package can become better!

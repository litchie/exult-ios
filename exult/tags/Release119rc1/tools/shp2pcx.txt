NAME

shp2pcx - extract images from a Shape (SHP) file into PCX files 

  
SYNOPSIS
========

shp2pcx SHAPE PREFIX PALETTE 

  
DESCRIPTION
===========

shp2pcx converts all frames contained in a Shape file into PCX-format image 
files. Shape files are used for storage of all visible elements (from UI buttons 
to terrain features) of the games Exult supports. 
SHAPE is the name of the Shape file acting as the source. Frames contained 
therein are saved as PCX files named PREFIXnn.pcx with nn replaced by the frame 
number (counting from zero). All PCX files get their palette from PALETTE. 
Before extraction the number of frames, and the Shape's origin coordinates are 
shown. Additionally, extraction progress is communicated by printing a message 
containing the resulting file's name for every processed frame. 
  

EXAMPLES
========
  shp2pcx orc.shp orc std.pal 
  Takes the frames contained in the Shape file orc.shp, and saves them with the 
  palette from std.pal into PCX files orc00.pcx, orc01.pcx, orc02.pcx, etc.

                                    EXULT
                                    =====

WHAT IS IT ?
------------
EXULT lets you play Ultima 7 - The Black Gate natively under Linux,
Windows, BeOS and MacOS.  It is released under the GNU General Public 
License, and source code is available.

See the "NEWS" and "ChangeLog" files for the latest changes.
Also, there are specific README files for several platforms. (README.platform)

IMPORTANT: Make sure you have a valid configuration file (see below).
Run "exult" on a clean installation of Ultima7; "exult" should either be
installed in a directory where you see the "static" subdirectory or the 
configuration file should point to the static directory.  "Exult" will
create the "gamedat" directory and files the first time you run it.  And al-
though I've tried to be safe about this, do not run it on an origina Ultima7
game which you're actually in the middle of playing, as Exult's saved files
have a different format.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
Exult keeps a configuration file. You can specify where your Ultima 7
installation is, whether you want full-screen graphics, or windowed, and
midi devices and midi settings. Some of these options can be set from the
"Setup" menu when you run Exult.

If you do not already have a configuration file, Exult will make one for you
filling in sensible defaults by itself. The location of this file varies 
slightly. On unix systems you can expect to find it in $HOME/.exult.cfg while 
other operating systems will probably locate it as 'exult.cfg' in the same 
directory as the exult binary. However it is recommended that you edit this 
file by hand to achieve optimal results for your system.

The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should be simple to
understand and modify. Take care though. Handling of syntax errors in this file
is not well tested.

Here is an example exult.cfg:

<config>
 <video>
  <fullscreen>
  no
  </fullscreen>
 </video>
 <gameplay>
  <cheat>
  no
  </cheat>
  <skip_intro>
  no
  </skip_intro>
 </gameplay>
 <disk>
  <game>
   <blackgate>
    <path>
    /home/user/mystuff/ultima/u7
    </path>
    <title>
    black_gate
    </title>
   </blackgate>
   <serpentisle>
    <path>
    /home/user/mystuff/ultima/si
    </path>
    <title>
    serpent_isle
    </title>
   </blackgate>
  </game>
 </disk>
 <audio>
  <speech>
   <enabled>
   yes
   </enabled>
  </speech>
  <midi>
   <kmidi>
    <device>
    5
    </device>
   </kmidi>
   <enabled>
   yes
   </enabled>
  </midi>
 </audio>
</config>

VIDEO
-----
By default Exult runs at 320x200 (which is the resolution the original
Ultima VII used). Exult uses the 2xSaI scaling engine by Derek Liauw to
double the size to 640x400 and increase the quality of the graphics.
More information on this excellent scaling engine is available at 
http://members.xoom.com/derek_liauw/
Your screen should be set to 16-bit color mode, and you need to
add the following to the <video> section of .exult.cfg:

   <width>
   320
   </width>
   <height>
   200
   </height>
   <scale>
   2
   </scale>

Within the game you can use the "ALT +" and "ALT -" to switch 
resolution/scaling modes.

AUDIO
-----
Exult can play the Ultima VII's speech through SDL, and its own
internal mixer. Configuration is managed through Exult's configuration file.
Since version 0.93alpha4 Exult supports digital SFX from .wav files.
Joseph Morris has made recordings of the SFX from the original U7,
which you can find through our SourceForge download page at
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2335
(look for jmsfx.zip and jmsfxsi.zip)

For more information see the FAQ (in the file 'FAQ' or at 
http://exult.sourceforge.net/faq.shtml)

MIDI
----
MIDI audio is available for both Linux and Windows users.
Exult automatically remaps the Ultima VII Midi music (which is in the XMIDI
format) to GM/GS instrument mapping, so the end result should be as close as
(or better) than the original.

COMPILING
---------

Exult uses the multiplatform library SDL by Sam Lantinga of LokiGames.  
SDL provides low-level graphics, timing and sound capabilities.
This made it much easier to create the ports to Windows, BeOS, MacOS, *BSD,
Solaris.

Unusual library dependencies
----------------------------
   Some of you may have SDL or other libraries that have been compiled with
unusual or inappropriate dynamic link paths. This typically affects linking
with the X11 libraries. You can add:
        --x-libraries=/usr/X11R6/lib

(or whatever your X11 library path is) to the configure command-line to get
around this problem.

Requirements:	Ultima7 must be installed and visible.  The "exult" executable
		should be placed in the top-level u7 directory (where "static"
		appears as a subdirectory), or the exult.cfg should contain
		the path to the U7 directory.

Installation:	Refer to the INSTALL file in the source distribution

Caveats:	The program is a memory hog.  Really makes me appreciate
		Origin's accomplishment in making it run under DOS.

Running:	Hold right mouse button down to move Avatar.
		Click on objects with left button to identify them.
		Double-click on characters to hold conversations.
		Double-click on doors, shutters with left button to open or
			close them.
		Arrow keys scroll around the "universe" when in 'cheat' mode.

		Some other useful keys:
		'h' brings up a 'help' scroll.
		'ctrl-h' brings up a 'cheat help' scroll.

Credits:	The paper by Gary Thompson on the structure of the U7 data
		files was crucial to the early development of Exult.

		Work by Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg, and Wouter Dijkslag 
		made the "usecode" interpreter possible.
		
		Thanks also go to the person who wrote u7items.txt and the
		contributor of the "avatar.ttf" font.

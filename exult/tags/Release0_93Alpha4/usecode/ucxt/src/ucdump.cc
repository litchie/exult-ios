 History:
 - originally written June 99 by Maxim S. Shatskih aka Moscow Dragon (maxim__s@mtu-net.ru)
 Thanks to Keldon Jones (keldon@umr.edu)
  and Wouter Dijklslag aka Wody Dragon (wody@wody.demon.nl) for their help
 11-Oct-99
  - added "function search by opcode & intrinsic" feature
  - added "unknown opcode & intrinsic counting" feature
 12-Oct-99
  - the good deal of intrinsic functions is now known
 
 The source must be buildable on any Win32 compiler - patch fopen()'s "wb"
  modes for UNIX. Help in porting on non-Win32 platforms is greatly appreciated.
 See source file comments for the description of usecode opcodes & intrinsic functions
  (the latter one differs between BG & SI)
 
 Some general usecode ideas:
 - usecode functions 0x0-0x3ff are shape handlers - called on double-clicks & other
  event with appropriate shapes
 - usecode functions 0x401-0x4ff are NPC handlers - called on double-clicks & other
  event with appropriate NPCs - NPCID + 0x400 (401 for Iolo, 417 for LB etc).
 - usecode functions 0x500-0x5ff is for Wisps & guards (nonNPC characters able to talk)
  (these ranges seems to be hardcoded)
 - stack machine used to execute bytecodes
 - the machine's state is:
  stack
  local variables(forgotten on function exit, first N of them are call arguments -
          first pushed is 0, next are 1, 2...)
  game flags
  ItemRef (???seems to be valid only for top-level functions-event handlers
        or maybe is persistent till quitting usecode executuion???)
  EventID (???seems to be valid only for top-level functions-event handlers
        or maybe is persistent till quitting usecode executuion???)
 - game flags are bytes treated as booleans (0/1), persistent across engine shutdown/restart
  and stored as a simple array (??? 0 or 1 based. Don't remember. Flag 3 means
  - Tetrahedron is down, flag 4 means - Sphere is down) in GAMEDAT\FLAGINIT.
 - usecode can also manipulate items & NPCs by means of intrinsic functions
 - "add" opcode can sum strings (concatenation). Also it can add integer to string
 - any array operations can be peformed on scalar values. In fact, each scalar value is
  treated by the array operations as an array with a single element. Vice versa is also
  true - for instance, ItemsNearItem() function returns an array. Sometimes it is used in
  enum/next loop as an array, but sometimes it is used as an itemref.
 - array indices are 1-based as in VB
 - itemref is a unique ID of the given item. For NPCs, itemref is (-NPCID). For other items,
  itemrefs seems to be non-persistent (not saved to savegame & re-invented on each
  engine startup)??? indexes into engine's item lists
 - there is a value called "referent" which identifies item & stored in U7IBUF
    Maybe Itemref is the same thing?
 - -356 is always an Itemref for Avatar. So, Avatar's NPC ID is possibly 356.
 - usecode execution starts from the event handler function. It is called by the engine
  without arguments (double-click) in some cases. ItemRef & EventID are set before entering usecode.
 - the easiest case is double-click on some item. In this case, a usecode event handler
  function called. Function ID usually matches the shape's Type number
  or is (NPCID + 0x400) for NPCs.
  ItemRef is set to the item double-clicked, EventID is set to 1 (double-click).
 - other causes for the engine to call usecode function:
  - events scheduled by intrinsic functions 1 & 2 have EventID 2
  - item is put on another item - the underlying item's handler is called with EventID 3
    (Penumbra's plaque)
  - usecode Egg - also calls a function with EventID 3
  - use item as a weapon (flammable oil) - EventID 4
  - NPC being beaten to death (examples: Hook in BG, Dracothaxus in FoV,
          Pomdirgun & Rotoluncia in SI) - 7 in SI???
  - Avatar & NPC approaching to some distance??? - 9 in SI
 - hex coords to sextant coords - ( x - 933 ) / 10, ( y - 1134 ) / 10

Exult instructions for MacOS
----------------------------


To play
-------
First you need to get Ultima 7. Either you own it already, or
you buy it somewhere. Then you must install it on a DOS/Windows
machine in order to get the data file. A good way is to use a
PC emulator for this, e.g. Virtual PC, Real PC or SoftWindows.

From the Ultima7 folder on your PC, copy the STATIC sub folder
to the folder that contains the ExultMac application.

Now run ExultMac, and have fun!



Notes
------
* Exult Mac has no Audio/Midi support yet (exult in general
has it, though).

* Exult generates the files 'stdout.txt' and 'stderr.txt'.
These may give you some idea of what is going on
under the hood. When Exult suddenly quits, sometimes
these files can help.

* You can build exult from the source yourself if you want, provided
you own a copy of CodeWarrior for MacOS. If you need help with that,
feel free to contact me at <mailto:max@quendi.de>

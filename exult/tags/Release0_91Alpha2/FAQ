1. Introduction

1.1.1. What is Exult?
From the Exult homepage:
Ultima 7, an RPG from the early 90's, still has a huge following. But, being a DOS game with a very 
non-standard memory manager, it is difficult to run it on the latest computers. Exult is a project to create 
an Ultima 7 game engine that runs on modern operating systems, using the data and graphics files that 
come with the game.
Exult is being developed in C++ under Linux using the SDL library to make porting to other platforms
relatively easy.  The current version supports much of the game's plot, allowing you to talk to
NPC's, use items, solve quests, and even fight monsters. Music, speech, and the full introduction are also
implemented. This, and further development, is only possible due to the work done by other fans who have
decoded the various Ultima7 data files, especially Gary Thompson, Maxim Shatskih, Jakob Shonberg,
and Wouter Dijkslag.
Exult aims to let those people who own Ultima 7 (copyright 1993) play the game on modern hardware,
in as close to (or perhaps even surpassing) its original splendor as is possible.
You need to own Ultima7: The Black Gate in order to use Exult,
and we encourage you to buy a legal copy.

1.1.2. Why is it called Exult - what is the meaning of this name?
Jeff wrote on the Boards:
I originally wrote it [Exult] solely for X-windows, so that's where the 'X' comes from. The "ult", of course, 
comes from Ultima. It was only about 6 months ago that I replaced the X code with SDL, which is 
multiplatform. Then Arthuris ported it to Win32 (and to BeOS). He had also ported the earlier version, but 
it was much harder to maintain that way.

Ibrahim Holtzmann:
I'd like to point out that "exult" is also an English verb that means "to
rejoice, to show extreme happiness."

1.2.1. Where do I find Exult?
-the latest official version is found on 
http://exult.sourceforge.net/

- the daily snapshot is found at
http://io.spaceports.com/~kirben/

1.2.2. What is a snapshot? Are these screenshots or what?
The snapshot is the newest source code of the program. It´s updated almost daily, sometimes twice a day.
There is information on how to build your own binary of the source but there is also the newest 
pre-compiled Windows binary.

1.2.3. How do I compile a source code snapshot under Linux?
1. Install the latest version of SDL
2. Extract the source code archive to ~/exult:
    unzip Exult.zip -d ~
3. Create a fresh install of U7. I'll assume that you've installed U7 in ~/ultima7
4. Run autogen.sh to create a configure script, then compile Exult:
     cd ~/exult; chmod u+x autogen.sh; ./autogen.sh; ./configure; make
5. Install Exult and the Exult data file:
    cp exult ~/ultima7; mkdir ~/ultima7/data; cp ./data/exult.flx ~/ultima7/data
6. Run Exult:
    cd ~/ultima7; ./exult

1.2.4. How do I compile a source code snapshot under Win 9x?
The source code snapshots contain a file called "README.win32" that explains everything.

1.3.1. What is the state of Exult?
V0.90 Alpha1Press ´ v´ in Game to see the "About-Box"

1.3.2. Can you play through U7 yet?
You can play through the Black Gate/Forge of Virtue without cheating and plotholes

1.4. On what platform does Exult run?
Exult should be able to be compiled (with minor modifications) on any
platform that SDL supports.
Right now the source can be compiled in Linux, MacOS, BeOS and Win32.

1.5. Who is the Exult Team?
- Jeff Freedman, a software developer working in the EDA industry in Oregon, has been fighting with 
Ultima7's graphics and usecode for nearly two years now. 

- Dancer Vesperman an Australian Internet Engineer/software developer who has added support for the 
Guardian's speech, music, and has done all the configuration work that a proper open-source project 
requires. 

- Willem Jan Palenstijn in the Netherlands, also known as "Arthuris Dragon", has done the Windows port, 
and is now working on a port to BeOS. 

-Tristan Tarrant resides in Italy, and is working on the ending sequence, startup screens, and 
configuration. He also plans to develop support for Serpent Isle. 

- Ryan Nunn, aka "Colourless Dragon", is working on a variety of game engine features, including 
movement, rendering and NPC flags. 

-Coder Infidel, a second-year CompSci student in W. Australia, has deciphered several of the U7 data 
files, and has also added weapon animation. 

- Max Horn in Lahnstein, Germany has offered to port to the Mac


2.Exult and Ultima 7

2.1. Do I need Ultima 7 ?
Yes. Exult won´t work without the original files.

2.2. Does Exult work on all versions of the game?
It seems to run most of the available versions of the game. The most common one
nowadays with added "Forge of Virtue" runs for sure.
However there are reported problems with the localized versions of the game (French and German).
Conversation threads don´t seem to skip to the next line in the proper places and
therefore are unreadable in some cases.
Jeff´s response:
I've been wondering a bit about that, but haven't had the time yet to deal with
language-specific issues. U7 appears to be fully localized, with all the
messages either in 'usecode' or 'text.flx'. But there are several places in
Exult where English is hard-coded in, and it would be nice to clean that up
sometime. About a month ago, I rewrote the conversation renderer to break
sentences at punctuation; maybe that will help with the German rendering.

2.3. How about Serpent Isle?
The team is working on it. It is not yet playable but you can walk around, talk to some people... Paperdolls are working now and plotwise you will get as far as the "Knight´s Test".

From the Board:
Colourless:
I can't say much about the what will happen except that completely working Serpent Isle will be an annoying task to complete. It is close to BG is some ways, but very different in others.

Jeff:
My feelings about SI are the same as Colourless, who has done all the work so far on it. I'd much prefer to add enhancements to BG (which would apply to SI as well), and perhaps write a new RPG. Now, if EA would provide us with information about SI's internals, that would change things. And also, since Exult is open-source, it would be fine if anyone wants to volunteer to work on SI.

2.4. Do the Add-Ons work? (Forge of Virtue (U7) and The Silver Seed (Serpent Isle))
Forge is supported. As SI is not yet fully running the same holds true for Silver Seed.

2.5.Where do I find Ultima 7 on the net to download?

Don´t ! You may be able to find it on the net but it would be pirating the game and the Exult team doesn´t 
support pirates. Look for the Ultima Collection in stores or on Ebay (ebay.com).

DON´T ask the team for copies.


3. Configurations, Resolution, Music

3.1.1. What is it with the Exult.cfg file?How do I change resolution?

Most of the switches in the exult.cfg file are now handled via  "Setup" when you start up Exult. For further understanding read the following descriptions.

From the ReadMe:
The file uses a simple hierarchical XML-like syntax, which should be simple to understand
and modify. Take care though. Handling of syntax errors in this file is not well tested.
Exult will create this file for you, with some sensible defaults, and you can then edit it
to suit your preferences.
okay, the default file looks like this (do not copy the **and following - these are my remarks).yes means enabled
no means disabled

</disable_fades>

</config>

3.1.2. What do I have to change in the Path-Settings?

You have two choices on how to setup Exult.

The first one is very easy, just extract all the files from the compiled snapshot archive to the directory where you have The Black Gate or Serpent Isle installed. Concerning the paths you don´t have to configure anything.

The other is a little more complicated but appeals to control freaks like me.
Make a directory C:\Ultima7
make two subfolders named "Blackgate" and "Serpent" (without the " " of course)
Extract or install the two Ultima 7 games into the appropiate folder (The Black Gate to C:\Ultima7\Blackgate and Serpent Isle to C:\Ultima7\Serpent)
Extract the compiled Exult to C:\Ultima7
Now you have to edit the exult.cfg file like this

<disk>
<data_path>
C:\Ultima7\data
</data_path>
<game>
<blackgate>
<path>
./Blackgate
</path>
<title>
blackgate
</title>
</blackgate>
<serpentisle>
<path>
./Serpentisle
</path>
</serpentisle>
</game>
</disk>

Word of advice : Don´t copy the files from the one game into the directory of the other. This would screw up either one. You may need to fill in the absolute path for some improvements to work, e.g. C:\Ultima7\Blackgate or C:\Ultima7\Serpentisle. See 4.5.1. to read what I´m speaking about :-)


3.2.1. Do music and sound effects play?
Yes. Music plays via Midi and sounds quite like the original. Sound effects also play via Midi.
Speech is also supported.
You can change the way the music and the sound effects play via the Setup or the exult.cfg file.
3.2.2. The sound effects sound horrible.
Well the music plays okay but the sound effects sound horrible, especially when opening a door. What´s 
up?

This due to the fact that the Sfx is played back through midi. For that to work properly you need the proper soundfont selected for your card. Not every soundcard supports soundfont-managing.  Creative´s AWE and Live! series support do support it. Okay if you have on of those cards this is how you do it:
Only Win32: (<-?)
1.Load up the Control Panel, select Multimedia Properties (or Sounds and Multimedia). Make sure that the Midi-playback device is the right one. For the SB Live! it has to be "SB Live! MIDI Synth". Don´t choose "Microsoft Synth" or similar.

2.You need a Sound Font Manager.
Creative either provides the AWE-Control panel or the Vienna Sound Font Manager, other 
sound card producers should have something similar. There also should be some Soundfont files (*.sf2 or *.sbk)

3. Select Bank: 000 or Synth
Load 4gmgsmt.sf2 or similar (You may have to try around a bit).

Now go into the game and test how the music works and if the soundFX sound okay.

3.2.3. How to turn of sound effects?
Since the snapshot release of 5.November 2000 it works like the original , press "s" to turn on/off Music, Speech and SoundFx
3.3. What does the Scale option mean?
By default Exult runs at 320x200 (which is the resolution the original
Ultima VII used). Exult uses the 2xSaI scaling engine by Derek Liauw to
double the size to 640x400 and increase the quality of the graphics.
More information on this excellent scaling engine is available at 
http://members.xoom.com/derek_liauw/Your screen should be set to 16-bit color mode
Within the game you can use the "ALT +" and "ALT -" to switch 
resolution/scaling modes. The game will save the last selected mode and reuse
it the next time you run Exult.

4. Keyboard Commands, Miscellaneous

4.1.What are the keys used in Exult?
Mainly the same you had in the original with the addition of some improvements.
During the game press "h" to see a help screen with all the keys

This brings up:
Keyboard commands
+/- - Change brightness
b -Use spellbook
c - Cmbat mode
f - Use food
h - Show keyboard commands
ctrl-h - Cheat commands
i - Show inventory
k -Try all keys to unlock a lock
m - Show map
p - use Lockpicks
Ctrl-p - repaint screen
Ctrl-s - Quick Save
Ctrl-Alt-s - Screenshot
Ctrl-r - Quick Restore
s - show save/load box
t -Target, instead of double clicking, shows a cursor and pauses the game until you click on something
z - show stats
w - Use watch, shows the time if you got a watch
v - About screen
F4 - Toggle fullscreen
Alt-x, F10, ESC - Exit game

In conversations you now have the ability not just click on the answer with the mouse but also to use the numeric keys. The response options aren´t numbered visually but logically with the dots. Also press "Esc" to select "bye" if possible.

4.2. I remember that there were Cheat codes for the original. Does Exult support these?
Not exactly in the same way, but a lot better.
press "ctrl+h" during the game to see the cheat menu

This brings up:
Cheat Commands
Arrow keys   - scroll map
Home   - recenter map
Alt-+/-   - switch resolution
Ctrl-b  - shape browser ( 's' goes to the next shape, 'f' to the next frame 
                                        within the shape, 'j' increments by 20, and 'v' switches files. Shift on any of these 
                                         goes backwards. Esc gets out of the mode)
Ctrl-c   - Create object
Ctrl-d   - delete object

Alt-s   - change skin color (SI)
Ctrl-t   - Next time period
Alt-t   - teleport (to cursor point)
Ctrl-Alt-t   - Map teleport
Alt-w  - toggle Archwizard mode
Ctrl-1 - Test Music, SFX, Speech

4.3.1. Do the various cheat rooms work?
yes

4.3.2. Where Do I find them?
keep on looking for them :-)

4.4. Do the carriages, ships and the magic carpet work?
Yes. The sail of ships look odd sometimes but otherwise these means of transportations work quite well.

4.5.1. Serpent Isle had many more improvements over Black Gate (keyring, better paperdoll...). Will these be 
implemented?
Right now the main goal is to get the Black Gate 100% working. After that it could be that some more 
things will be improved as far as it is possible to implement these.The keyring is not in Black Gate but there is the k key which tries all the keys in the inventory to open a lock.

Recently Ryan added paperdoll support in Black Gate. Though it is still buggy (some items disappear to Neverneverland) it is beautiful to look at. Very impressive. For this you need to have Serpent Isle installed on your hard drive and you must set the absolut path to it (see 3.1.2.)

4.5.2. Any other improvements/features?
In exult, you can still move your party even if there is a box/body/stats open/on....
In the original, the world was kind of frozen. Now it is only frozen if you hit the 't','s' or 'ESC' key...

4.6. I heard that Exult is meant to be a game engine. Can I make my own game with Exult?
Work has begun on "Exult Studio" which is aimed to be a Editor for all kinds of files that are used by Ultima 7. As of now there is already a Gimp plug-in to edit shapes.

Jeff:
As for the future, my main plan is to add editing capabilities, with the long-range goal of writing an original RPG.


5.Bugs, known issues, and not yet implemented features

5.1. Bugs

To see a list of open bugs and bugreports go to http://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=2335

5.2. Known Issues
* Movement is sometimes jerky or slow.
* We don't know what all the data in 'weapons.dat' and 'ammo.dat' means, so hit points and damage don't work as well as in the original game.

5.3.Not yet implemented
* Maybe a few magic spells that don't work

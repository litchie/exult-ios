ExultStudio TODO
================

This is a braindump of what I want to do with ExultStudio.

I think the app should behave in a similar way to the Gimp, with a master 
window and additional windows for each aspect that is being browsed/modified.

The Toolbar
===========

The first step in getting ExultStudio into a useful state is to create a 
"super browser" of sorts. Point it at the game's "static" directory 
and it will classify all the files it finds there in a list. Clicking on 
a file brings up a specific browser for that file's type. The following
browsers should be designed:

	Shape
	Palette
	NPC
	IFIX
	Usecode
	Chunk
	Superchunk
	Map
	Flex
	Flic
	Voc
	MIDI
	Weapon

Shape
=====

Handles:	.shp .vga
Drag to:	Chunks, Flex, GIMP
Drop from:	Flex

Palette

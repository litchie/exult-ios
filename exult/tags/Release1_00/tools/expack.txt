expack - manipulate Flex files 
  

SYNOPSIS
========

expack -a FLEXFILE FILE... 
expack -c FLEXFILE FILE... 
expack -x FLEXFILE [INDEX] 
expack -i MANIFEST 
expack -l FLEXFILE 
  

DESCRIPTION
===========

expack is a command-line utility that lets you extract and create Flex files. 
Flex files are archives (which means that they act as containers for other 
files, somewhat like directories) used by Ultima 7 to store most of its data. 
Note that the names of the original files are not stored in the Flex --- files 
are only retrievable by their index. 

  
Modes of operation
==================


  -a Add 
  --NOT IMPLEMENTED YET.  FUTURE ENHANCEMENT--
  This command adds one or more FILEs to the end of FLEXFILE. 

  -c Create 
  This command takes one or more FILEs and bundles them into FLEXFILE, 
  overwriting it in the process. 

  -x Extract 
  Lets you extract the files contained within FLEXFILE. If INDEX is given only 
  the file at this position will be unpacked, otherwise all files are extracted. 
  The created files will be named index.u7o. 

  -i Input 
  Similar to "Create", this command creates FLEXFILE from a number of input 
  files. However, "Input" takes the names of the input files from MANIFEST 
  instead of the command line. 
  MANIFEST must be a list of file names, one per line. The first name is that of 
  the Flex file that is to be created, the rest are the input files used in 
  building it. 

  -l List 
  This command lists the contents of a FLEXFILE. It gives you the number of 
  files contained within the Flex file, as well as the length of each file.

  expack -c animals.flx duck.wav cat.wav cow.wav dog.wav 
  Creates a new Flex file animals.flx containing duck.wav, cat.wav, cow.wav, and 
  dog.wav.
 
  expack -x text.flx 17 
  Extracts the file at position 17fromtext.flxinto17.u7o.
 
  expack -x text.flx 
  Extracts all files from text.flx into files named 0.u7o, 1.u7o, 2.u7o, etc. 
  expack -i wavlist 
  With wavlist reading: 
  jmsfx.flx
